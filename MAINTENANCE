Handy stuff to know for people maintaining gtranslator.


How to make a release
---------------------

If you're planning to make a release, let gnome-i18n@gnome.org as soon as possible, and give them a few days to update their translations. Also, let gtranslator-devel@lists.sourceforge.net know, in case anyone has any last minute bugfixes for inclusion.

Check the version information in configure.in is up-to-date.

Then, do the following:

cvs rtag -R gtranslator-1-0-1 gtranslator
cvs export -r gtranslator-1-0-1 gtranslator
cd gtranslator
./autogen.sh
make dist

This will give you the '.tar.gz' tarball. Do a test build to ensure there are no obvious mistakes or omissions in the tarball before it's made public.

Send a copy of the tarball to Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org> for upload to <http://www.gtranslator.org/>, and upload a copy to SourceForge using the fancy release mechanism.

Fill out an announcement form on the GNOME website. Forward the announcement to gtranslator-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
