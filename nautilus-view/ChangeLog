	* main.c & nautilus-gtranslator-view.c: Made all the includes 
		absolute as the ../src directory is already included in the
		 $CFLAGS and enabled i18n and made some messages translatable
		  -- but not all strings as the Mail interface will surely get
		    blown away quite soon.

	* .cvsignore: Added all the files which should be ignored (object
		files, executables, .deps, .libs etcc).

	* nautilus-view/*: Added the nautilus-gtranslator-view sources
		to gtranslator and added automake/autoconf based build
		 scheme.
