	* nautilus-gtranslator-view.c: Made the "mailto:" URLs 
		nonlocalized (Pablo, you're definitely right .-)).

2001-03-15  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added nautilus-gtranslator-view.h to the sources
		so that it should also get into a distpackage.

2001-03-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

2001-03-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

2001-03-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added parse_core.o to the dependencies objects.

	* nautilus-gtranslator-view.c: Removed all Mail interface stuff and
		made it use the new outsourced pure parse function parse_core
		 -- it works now again.

2001-02-27  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c & nautilus-gtranslator-view.c: Made all the includes
		absolute as the ../src directory is already included in the
		 $CFLAGS and enabled i18n and made some messages translatable
		  -- but not all strings as the Mail interface will surely get
		    blown away quite soon.

	* .cvsignore: Added all the files which should be ignored (object
		files, executables, .deps, .libs etc.).

	* nautilus-view/*: Added the nautilus-gtranslator-view sources
		to gtranslator and added automake/autoconf based build
		 scheme.
