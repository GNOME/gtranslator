	* text/Makefile.am: Fix for FreeBSD as suggested by Maxim Sobolev.

2001-12-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* text/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): add GAL_CFLAGS

2001-10-09  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* text/text.c: Followed Kjartan's suggestion and added an fclose at the
		end of the "backend_save" function; also added '\r' to the list
		 of separation characters for the "backend_open" function.

2001-09-02  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* text/text.c: Adept for the major source changes in gtranslator.

2001-09-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* text/text.c: Adept for the new GtrRuntimeConfig structure -- we do
		use an own temporary filename for backend files now.

2001-08-30  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* text/text.c: Use the same temporary filename for the transition po-
		file as for the compressed/compiled po files and open the
		 created po file afterwards -- also add a source comment for
		  every created po file message.

2001-08-29  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* text/text.c: Main logic change; parsing works now but currently we
		do save the resulting po file into a file named "text.po"; this
		 will change soon.

2001-08-10  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* text/text.c: More implementation, addition of some missing stuff --
		more assertions, but still not working .-(

2001-08-02  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* text/text.c: Some more logic for splitting the "messages".

2001-07-21  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* text/text.c: Include "../(../)utils.h" for GTR_FREE; also made
		the "parsing" routines a bit more working.

2001-07-07  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* docbook/docbook.c & text/text.c: Include "comment.h" and changed
		the sources for the usage of GtrComment's everywhere.

2001-05-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* translation-memories/*: Removed all TM backends; Semerkent
		is developed for this case, so we don't need any
		 special backends anymore.

	* Makefile.am: Removed translation-memories from subdirs.

2001-05-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* text/text.c: Small changes to really detect the newlines.

2001-05-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* translation-memories/*/Makefile.am: Install the backends into
		$(libdir)/gtranslator/translation-memories.

2001-05-12  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* text/text.xml: Corrected a small typo in the xml file: the closing
		tag is of course also "filenames", and not "filename".

2001-04-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* \*/*: Changed all xml descriptor files according to the new
		"design" of the backends in backend.c/.h.

2001-04-24  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* translation-memories/opentag/* & translation-memories/tmx/*:
		Added skeleton files for translation memories backends
		 (Makefile.ams, .cvsignores and other build files).

2001-04-19  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* docbook/docbook.c & text/text.c: Added prototypes for all the
		functions.

2001-04-10  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* docbook/Makefile.am: Include the gal cflags in the compile
		cflags (already includes the xml cflags .-)).

	* docbook/docbook.c: Started off writing some fake'sh starting
		points -- huh, will be something more complex I guess.

	* text/* & docbook*: Outsource the information about compilability
		and compile commands into the xml descriptor files.

	* text/text.c: Semi-finished the text backend file.

	* text/text.c & docbook/docbook.c: Changed the call names a bit
		to get closer to what they should be in future.

	* po: Removed the "po" subdirectory.

	* Makefile.am: Remove the "po" subdirectory from SUBDIRS.

2001-04-09  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* */*: Added cvsignore files.

	* po/po.xml, text/text.xml & docbook/docbook.xml: Changed the
		format a bit and prepared future translations for these
		 xml files.
	
	* Makefile.am: Added the three subdirectories to this main Makefile
		and removed all the backends cruft.

	* ChangeLog: Added this ChangeLog for the backends.

	* po, text & docbook: Put the backends into different
		subdirectories.
