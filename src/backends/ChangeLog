	* translation-memories/*: Removed all TM backends; Semerkent

		 special backends anymore.

	* Makefile.am: Removed translation-memories from subdirs.

2001-05-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* text/text.c: Small changes to really detect the newlines.

2001-05-12  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* text/text.xml: Corrected a small typo in the xml file: the closing

2001-04-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* \*/*: Changed all xml descriptor files according to the new
		"design" of the backends in backend.c/.h.

2001-04-24  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* translation-memories/opentag/* & translation-memories/tmx/*:

2001-04-19  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* docbook/docbook.c & text/text.c: Added prototypes for all the
		functions.

2001-04-10  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* docbook/Makefile.am: Include the gal cflags in the compile
		cflags (already includes the xml cflags .-)).

	* docbook/docbook.c: Started off writing some fake'sh starting
		points -- huh, will be something more complex I guess.

	* text/* & docbook*: Outsource the information about compilability
		and compile commands into the xml descriptor files.

	* text/text.c: Semi-finished the text backend file.

	* text/text.c & docbook/docbook.c: Changed the call names a bit
		to get closer to what they should be in future.

	* po: Removed the "po" subdirectory.

	* Makefile.am: Remove the "po" subdirectory from SUBDIRS.

2001-04-09  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* */*: Added cvsignore files.

	* po/po.xml, text/text.xml & docbook/docbook.xml: Changed the
		format a bit and prepared future translations for these
		 xml files.
	
	* Makefile.am: Added the three subdirectories to this main Makefile
		and removed all the backends cruft.

	* ChangeLog: Added this ChangeLog for the backends.

	* po, text & docbook: Put the backends into different
		subdirectories.
