2000-10-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* gui.c: Added "Recent files" submenu into the File tree and
		put some dope stuff around it.

	* parse.c/h: Added Recent file menus on top of the libgnome's
		gnome_history interface. It works! Still needs 
		 preferences merging...

	* parse.c/h: Added the update function's skeleton -- nothing
		real has been written yet.

	* prefs.c: Added another option to disable the update function
		as you need the original package sources for this
		 ( gtranslator will use the update.pl scripts in the
		    ./po-dir for this ) and as you need the sources.

	* gui.c: Added an "Update" button to the toolbar and to the
		menus; till now this hasn't got any use as the function
		 isn't written yet but that will happen soon....
		Enable/Disable this entry & button accordingly to the
		 option set in the preferences and to the case if a
		  file is opened or not.

2000-10-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* gui.c: Added more "live" statusbar update for the status
		information on change of a fuzzy message, removed
		 the now obsolete FIXME entries and corrected some
		  wrong enable/disable actions.

	* parse.c: Check if msgfmt is installed in $PATH, and show up
		and gnome_app_error if it can't be found by the
		 gnome_is_program_in_path routine from libgnome.
		Don't free a string variable ( "frees" a crash ) and
		 check if we'd used the new dot char feature and if so
		  replace the dot chars again with free spaces. This does
		   solve all FIXME's. Hurray.

	* \*.c: Added 3 FIXME's which are the three places where 
		gtranslator crashes regularly; these are FIXME's :)

2000-10-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* gui.c: Added some more conditionals in hope of avoiding more
		crashes, changed the descriptions of the new page's
		 toggle buttons a bit and removed a g_free as I can't
		  see any reason why to free a variable which is again
		   filled 10 lines after the free-ing process.
		Only react if the option is set in the preferences.

	* prefs.c: Added a 4th page with the options to use the dot char
		feature and to enable/disable the popup menu. Both of them
		 are working in real-time, you can also immediately see the
		  changes in the preferences on the next screen; also moved
		   the save geometry option to the "Miscellaneous" page.

	* parse.c: Add a new GNOME history entry if the file should be parsed,
		so we can later use it in a "Recent files" menu or a favorites
		 or something-alike menu.

2000-10-02  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Put the main.c file at the start of the
		compilation process.

	* main.c: Added an #error define to "avoid" GConf compilations
		for now.

	* gui.c: Changed the popup menu a bit and integrated some
		 kind of more intelligent menu ( though it's too
		  big and doesn't have got intelligence like the
		   toolbar till now ... ).
		Added a beta-alpha version of the dotchar-stuff
		 which does cause more crashs... grrrr...

2000-10-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* gui.c: Only activate the popup-menu for the two
		text boxes.

	* \*.*: Removed all gtranslator_config_init &
		gtranslator_config_close calls as libgtranslator's
		 functions are doing this now on their own.

2000-09-30  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* gui.c: Added the popup-menu for gtranslator; it
		reacts only on rightclick on the text-boxes
		 and should be more expanded later on; also
		  added another menu which some entries.

	* gui.h: Added the prototype for the popup-menu.

	* parse.c: Also free the segments of the GString.

	* main.c: Removed the error message stuff.

	* session.c: Removed some unneeded stuff.

2000-09-29  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* main.c: More informations on a GConf error.

2000-09-24  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* dialogs.c, header_stuff.c, session.c & prefs.c:
		Adapted the settings variables to GConf-style.

	* dnd.h: Moved the D'n'D types and enumeration to the
		right places.
	
	* gui.c: The GtkTargetEntries are now settled in here.

	* dnd.h: The enumeration of the D'n'D types is now here.

	* dialogs.c, header_stuff.c & session.c : Include the
		libgtranslator/preferences.h header for the
		 preferences routines of libgtranslator.

	* main.c: Include the GConf header if necessary and
		take the right argument style to the 
		 gconf_init function :)

2000-09-23  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* main.c: Init the GConf library if it's present.

	* find.c: Check if we did get any message before operating
		on it.

2000-09-21  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* prefs.c: Include the "libgtranslator/preferences.h" header.

	* header_stuff.c & dialogs.c: Use only relative paths as this
		would cause a mess in libgtranslator.

	* \*.c: Merged all gnome_config routines to use the libgtranslator
		routines.

	* prefs.c: Use "Do not..." for "Don't..." in the preferences
		settings.

2000-09-20  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* gui.c: Don't let me say that this correction has got also
		something to do with the icons in the searchbar ...

2000-09-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* \*.c/h: Reformatted my mail appearance from '[ kabalak@gmx.net ]'
		to '<kabalak@gmx.net>'.

	* gui.c: Integrated the status informatin into the statusbar and made
		some corrections to these weird searchbar stuff; it should
		 now get disabled/enabled the right way.

2000-09-16  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse.c: Made some more messages translatable and removed the
		check_file function; we're now using the libgnome-function
		 g_file_exists for that. If there's no such file, it does
		  now use a gnome_app_error to display the error, doesn't
		   parse anything and the app is still there ( hehe,
		    no crash ).
		 
		Also disabled the Save button if the file has been saved
		 and haven't been changed since then.

	* parse.h: Removed the check_file prototype as the function
		isn't used/included anymore.

	* gui.c: Corrected another wrong addiction (icon number was wrong),
		added also a fuzzy icon to the searchbar and made the Fuzzy
		 icon react with the same intelligence like the Missing
		   icon.

2000-09-15  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: The file is now named TODO.src and not only
		TODO.

	* gui.c: Enable the Goto button if a file has been opened and
		disable the menu entry for "Undo" if no file hasn't
		 been opened; also corrected the wrong menu entry
		  behaviour.

2000-09-13  Jesus Bravo Alvarez  <jba@pobox.com>

	* languages.h: Modified Galician team's e-mail address.

2000-09-13  Robert Brady  <rbrady@suse.de>

	* header-stuff.c: (split_name_email) Don't crash if
	str == NULL.

	(get_header) Deal with Project-Id-Version: lines with
	missing version numbers.

	* gui.c: Disable the translation string box if
	no .po is loaded.
	
2000-09-13  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* gui.c: Changed the hotkey for the next fuzzy translation
		to Alt + Z ( slightens the menus a bit ) and changed
		 the icon-caption to "Missing" as this doesn't break
		  the look of the toolbar.

2000-09-12  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gnome-regex.*: reverted to original files from gnome-libs,
		just added 'flags' field to GnomeRegexCache, and check for it
		before comparing patterns. Start search from 0th item
		(was 1st).
	* find.c: for_each_msg -- fail if start item == NULL; iterate on any
		list, not messages. In other functions, added check to pass not
		NULL to this function.
	* dialogs.c: made find dialog option fit in one line.

2000-09-11  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Removed msg_db.* as they'ren't any longer in
		our sources.

	* msg_db.*: Removed these files as we'll give the duty for this
		to gtranslatord.

	* prefs.c/h: Removed all message db parts.

	* gui.c: Removed all message db concerning menus & icons.

	* dialogs.c/h: Removed the query dialog & the query results
		dialogs for now ( including all widgets and variables.)

	* main.c: Removed all msg_db stuff and also cleansed the options
		and message db inits.

2000-09-10  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Added the gnome-regex sources to the build sources
		without any conditional tests ( libgnome doesn't have got
		 the gnome_regex_cache_new_with_size ).
	
2000-08-23  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* main.c, parse.c: now absolute file name is got in parse(), wherever
		it was called from. Added some newline, removed some comments,
		to ease the reading of huge parse() and main() functions.
		Ensured file_opened is always in sane state and is checked
		before doing anything with po structure (this avoids
		segfaults).
	* ChangeLog: why lose so much space on this file -- reformatted
		Fatih's	entries to be like mine. So there's half lines, but
		size reduced only by 3k...
	* gui.c: destroy regex cache on quit.
	* parse.c: created actual_parse function, and moved to it the real
		parsing from parse() to make it more clean. Change the title
		of window to contain the filename. In actual_write, check if
		the file has *.pot extension; if so, warn and do nothing.
	* spell.h, spell.c, gui.c: moved spelling code from gui.c to new
		separate files.
	* Makefile.am: added those two files to sources.
	* find.c: in for_each_msg, reverted to jump to po->messages when NULL
		reached, because of problem when passing first == NULL.
	* dialogs.c: added fake option menu to select where to find in.

2000-08-22  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gui.c: in update_msg, make both msgid and msgstr end with or without
		'\n'.
	* session.*, main.c: added restore_session(), if client is restored. So
		now goes to the same file and message number.
	* dialog.c: renamed variables in goto_dlg to shorter ones; added policy
		set on spin; changed dialog and label titles.

2000-08-21  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* Makefile.am: some cosmetic changes, use variables instead of simple
		../. Added -DGNOMELOCALEDIR. Added check for
		HAVE_MY_REGEX_CACHE, if to compile and link gnome-regex.
	* main.c: use realpath for getting absolute path.
	* session.c: gtranslator now opens the same file on session restore.
		Removed non-interesting comments.
	
2000-08-21  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* header_stuff.c: yeah, at last this works perfectly. Too much changes
		to list, anyway it's almost complete rewrite. Changed only
		get_header, put_header and edit_header. Use regexps to parse
		fields. A VERY enhanced edit dialog.

2000-08-20  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* parse.*, messages.h, dialogs.c, gui.c, find.c, session.c: at last
		moved all file-specific stuff to GtrPo structure, in that
		inserted new field -- messages list 'length'.
	* header_stuff.*: in GtrHeader, splitted language_team into two fields:
		language and lg_email; also, replaced 'mime_type' with
		'charset'.
	
2000-08-20  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gnome-regex.h, gnome-regex.c: copied these files here from
		gnome-libs/libgnome, because I needed to change the cache
		object so that it stored compilation flags along with pattern
		and regex. Added new type GnomeRegexCacheSlot, for saving all
		info about one regex. Also, changed everything else to reflect
		this change. Function API did not change, just added new
		function: gnome_regex_cache_new_with_size. However, types HAVE
		changed, although they should be used only internally.
	* Makefile.am: added above new files, although should be checked if
		they are needed.
	* parse.h: added check for gnome library version, which I will
		commit my above changes to. Use local file, if not found.
	* msg_db.*: Cleaned up a lot, fixed much errors, got no warnings.
		Though not needed...
	* find.c: in for_each_msg, get first element of given list, not
		messages.

2000-08-17  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* Again big changes. Read below: prefs.h, allmost all .c: Instead of
		many if_* variables for preferences, created one structure
		'wants.*', which uses only one bit for toggles.
	* prefs.c: new option: if message was fuzzy, when changed, it could be
		marked non-fuzzy. Changed order of options in dialog. Moved all
		#defines to where they are used, and inserted #undefs
		immediatelly after. Authors name & e-mail are now GtkEntry's,
		not GnomeEntry's.
	* parse.c, gui.c: made check_msg_status internal, used only for
		parsing. Other functions (update_msg and mark_msg_fuzzy) change
		the status theirselves. Rewritten update_msg,
		toggle_msg_status. Now all the job with fuzzy entries does
		mark_msg_fuzzy function. After toggling status, message is
		updated. In text_has_got_changed, added call to unmark fuzzy,
		if wanted.
	* messages.h: moved all typedefs to struct/enum, so we don't need _Type
		hacks. Rewritten GtrPo type, to contain entries we actually
		use.
	* And, while changed much, executable has got only 700 bytes, so it was
		worth work.

2000-08-17  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* parse.*: added mark_msg_fuzzy function, which does actual change to
		message comment. Renamed get_msg_status to update_msg_status
		and changed return type to void. Added rxc -- a regexp cache.
	* gui.*: added a simple 'Undo' menuitem, ACT_UNDO action,
		undo_changes function. When toggled fuzzy status, call
		mark_msg_fuzzy.
	* find.c: use regexps to find. Added update_flags for match case
		updating.
	* main.c: create rxc and change it's size.
	
2000-08-16  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* dnd.*, find.*, parse.*: just another rearrangement of #include's.
	* dnd.*: removed gtr_dnd_type -- use guint instead. Removed a_counter
		variable, cleaned up lots of comments.
	* .cvsignore: added tags & .libs

2000-08-15  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* prefs.*, header_stuff.c: Lots of changes: moved all language lists to
		prefs.h, introduced lang_ref reference counting variable,
		create_lists() and destroy_lists(). All attach_*_with_label()
		are now in prefs.h, i.e. can be used with any other dialog.
		That was done because edit_header now creates GnomePropertyBox,
		not just dialog, and lets change language properties in header.

2000-08-14  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* main.c: simplified main() function, by moving geometry stuff to
		prefs.*. Query now only prints the result, no sick messages.
	* prefs.*: created save_geometry() and restore_geometry(), removed
		gtranslator_geometry_* variables, so that other files do not
		have anything to do with geometry. Geometry is loaded only if
		wanted. Added GTR_CONFIG_PREFIX.
	* gui.c: simplified gtranslator_quit.
	
2000-08-10  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gui.c: initial spell checking support. It does not work well,
		but works! I was impressed when I found gnome-spell.h!
	
2000-08-10  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* find.*, gui.*: renamed search_do to find_do. Created new
		for_each_msg function, which works the same as g_list_foreach,
		except that it starts from specified position, and jumps to
		first when end reached. All functions in find.h now uses it.
		Added goto_next_untranslated function, action and callback.
	* gui.c: fixed toggle_msg_status (rewrite). Created new
		function enable_actions_just_opened, which is just a statement,
		for convenience moved from parse.c. ACT_END is now initialized
		to NULL, I think it introduced a crash before.
		update_msg now marks message as untransalted if the
		translation was removed.

2000-08-09  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* header_stuff.[ch]: added update_header function, which
		PO-Revision_Date field.
	* parse.c: called above from actual_write().
	* find.[ch], gui.[ch]: added new menu item -- "Next fuzzy", callback
		for it, ACT_NEXT_FUZZY action (which is disabled when there are
		no more fuzzy messages).

2000-08-08  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* header_stuff.[ch]: added put_header (what a bad name...) function.
		Also, enriched GtrHeader structure with comment field, filled
		it in get_header and freed in free_header.
	* parse.c: because of above change, removed header_li variable. Now the
		header list item is completely destroyed, and created a new
		message when writing the file. Also, give a warning if file has
		no header. In parse(), prepend a message to messages, and then
		reverse - optimization for speed. Removed some comments, where
		the code was self-explanatory. Added a check if any line was
		read, if none -- give an error (and do not crash :)). In
		compile() -- write the po-file to temporary one, and compile
		this -- so you don't need to save before compile.

2000-08-08  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gui.c: added update_appbar function and call to it. This shows
		current message in the statusbar. Also connected
		clear_selection callback.
	* parse.c: when compiling, show two dialogs, depending on success:
		a message with message counts, or an error message.
	* dialogs.c: added compile_error_dialog function, which shows error
		text, which occurred during compiling.

2000-08-07  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* *.*: reformatted everything with "indent -i8 -kr -l78 -fca -fc1".
		From now I will use Linux kernel coding style
		(/usr/src/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle).
	* gui.[ch]: complete rewrite of "actions" code. Hash table was replaced
		by a static array, and string identifiers -- by integer IDs.
		This prevents typos, and saves a lot of memory and time. Also
		done some reformatting of code and comments (removed some of
		them).
	* find.c: optimized search functions, implemented case insensitive
		search.
	
2000-08-06  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* *.*: got the CVS 2000-08-04 version, today merged them all. I see
		now, that almost none changes made here by Fatih, only by me.
		That's good. gui.c, dialogs.c, prefs.c were totally rewritten
		by me, diff was confused :).
	* main.c: removed free(langs) because we do not own system environment.
		init the msg_db and parse-db only if if_use_msg_db is TRUE.
		Removed pointless pushing - and popping of prefix. Moved query
		handle to front, because then we do not need anything more.
		Also, moved parsing of file after creating the app (if there
		are problems with gui, don't bother with parsing). Because
		filename setting is done in parse(), removed
		gtranslator_set_filename from here.
	* prefs.c: made not use msg db by default, as I could not make program
		not to crash myself.
	* header_stuff.c: fixed that mime_type was not read. Also made new
		header to be filled with zeroes, in case some header field was
		not available.
	* gui.h and so on: moved some #includes to gui.c, this caused
		more #includes to change in another files. Hope now compiles
		faster.
	* find.*: removed crazy stuff (everything :)) and moved search_do
		function to here.
	* gui.c: because goto_given_msg(GList *) already existed, simplified
		all other goto_* to one line with call to it.

2000-08-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* TODO.src: Added some thoughts.
	
	* ChangeLog: Reformatted my entries partly.

2000-08-04  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* about.c: Updated the about-message.

        * ChangeLog: Merged with menesis' ChangeLog.

	* main.c: Added the gettext-init of the poptTable.

	* session.c: disabled the filename storage for now.

2000-08-04  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* dialogs.*: done the SAME :) with find dialog. That is, made gnome
		dialog with icon/parent/wmclass...
	* prefs.[ch],dialogs.c,header_stuff.c: two new preferences:
		if_match_case (for find dialog) and if_fill_header (for edit
		header dialog). Save them to config.
	* gui.c: written the search_do function and connected it where needed!
		Added a function goto_given_msg, which accepts list item as
		user_data.
	
2000-08-03  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* prefs.c: ended cleanup. Instead of defines, made some functions to
		simplify creating of many similar entries. Will use soon in
		edit_header, maybe...
	* parse.c: fixed the bug with ~ and ! :) now should get correct status.

2000-08-02  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* prefs.c: a major cleanup. Moved all widgets from .h to .c and made
		them static, removed unused ones. Added free_prefs(), which
		cleans memory, allocated with read_prefs; also, prefs_box_close
		callback, which destroys the lists when box closes. Moved the
		code, which initializes the lists, _before_ settting the entries
		with saved values. Added lots of #defines, so that code was more
		readable, because there were lots of very similar lines. Made
		apply callback react only to page_num==-1.
	* main.c,...: moved some variables used only here from various .h.
		There's almost no warnings now...

2000-08-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Added the libgtranslator dir to the includes
		and to the LDFLAFS/LDADD variables.

2000-08-01  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* prefs.c: Simplified widget creation and initialization, perhaps just
		removed lots of whitespace... Sorted items in the lists, and
		left only unique ones.

2000-07-31  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* dialogs.c: made a new modal ask_to_save_file dialog, It is more
		simple and works perfect! Even in open_file, I used this
		to ask if to save current file before opening new one.
	* gui.[ch]: do not declare gtranslator_quit in gui.h. Changed the
		type of this callback to such as it should be. Applied the
		above change, so modified files are always saved, if the user
		wants to. Added close callback and "action".
	* parse.c: changed the argument of parse(const char*). Made a simplier
		dialog to ask if saving unchanged files. The same to reverting
		a file. Also, used the nice ask_to_save_file, now saving,
		opening, closing and reverting is simple, consistent and safe.

2000-07-30  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* main.c: removed -f option from popt table, instead used context for
		getting files to load from command line. Now a file can be
		loaded simply by 'gtranslator lt.po'. Removed duplicating
		testing if file is valid, and a bunch of non-interesting
		comments and braces {}.
	* prefs.c: minor changes -- added some default values, removed
		gnome_config_drop_all() call, because this is done
		automatically.

2000-07-28  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* dialogs.c: added ask_to_save function, to be used when closing
		application, and file is unsaved. It works now.
	* gui.*: added disable_actions_no_file, because it is used
		in main.c and when closing file. Added nothing_changes
		variable, it was needed in text_has_got_changed to determine if
		the user or program changes the textbox. Added the callback for
		revert. gtranslator_quit now checks if file was changed. Also,
		closes it (frees the memory). Moved setting of status in front
		of file, because only then it could be seen. Message status in
		menus now reflects to real state of message (display_msg).
	* parse.*: added revert_file and close_file callbacks. Also,
		free_messages function.

2000-07-24  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>
	
	* Everywhere: renamed type names to conform with Glib ones:
		gtr_msg now is GtrMsg, type cast is GTR_MSG(), the same for
		status, header, action, po.
	* header_stuff.c,parse.c: at last header parsing is complete!
		get_header works fine. Edit header dialog also works, though
		there's not much... (maybe shouldn't be).
	* dialogs.c,prefs.c,about.c: added check GNOME_IS_DIALOG(*dlg) to
		show_nice_dialog, so if *dlg is a GnomeDialog, this function
		sets parent of it to be the main app.
	* gui.c: in Message status menu, merged Untranslated and Translated
		into one toggle item :) Still no callbacks.
	* messages.h,parse.c: revised GtrMsgStatus. Now there are only three
		possible stati: translated, fuzzy, and stick, and they are
		flags, so message can be translated AND fuzzy.

2000-07-23  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* Too much changes to list. After all, I see no pooint in writing this
		file. Anyway, I have changed EVERYTHING here. Almost. Major
		changes and achievements follows:
	* gui.c: major revision. Moved all toolbar creation stuff to
		GnomeUIInfo structure, rearranged all menus and toolbars,
		simplified them, made them standard (stock), removed the
		duplicated find/search entries, changed message status menu to
		toggles/radio items. Created new "actions" framework for
		enabling/disabling of menu/toolbar entries. Works very well.
		Before you load a file you can't do much :) Removed lots of
		stuff from create_app1(), so it looks nice. Of course,
		goto_*_msg got changed *much*, now they change actions only
		if needed.
	* gui.h: respectyvely, changed this file. Removed all global variables,
		except app1, appbar1, text1, trans_box, and
		gtranslator_geometry. Added actions stuff.
	* header_stuff.[ch]: finally, made the edit_header dialog like others.
	* main.c: minor clean up, related to changes in gui.*. Removed the
		duplicated app1 variable.
	* parse.c: moved compile() function to here. Made Save button actually
		react to settings, so -- ask if to save unchanged files, or do
		not save at all. file_changed should be always in correct
		state now.

2000-07-23  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* dialogs.c: Removed no_changes_dialog. Instead added to
	* parse.c: Added save_current_file (a callback for save), actual_write,
		no_reply_callback functions.
	* gui.c: added callbacks for Save.
	
2000-07-22  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* dialogs.*,../po/POTFILES.in,Makefile.am: renamed from gtr_dialogs.*
	* gui.c: moved get_*_msg, display_msg, update_msg, reached_*_msg,
		do_seach from parse.c to here, because they have nothing to do
		with parsing... renamed get_*_msg to goto_*_msg. removed the
		setting status in compile() when no file is opened. It should be
		disabled anyways. In clean_text_boxes() replaced everything with
		just two gtk_editable_delete_text(...) calls. Replaced
		gtk_text_get_length with -1 :)
		Removed View menu as it has no point.
	* dialogs.[ch]: added convenience functions raise_and_return_if_exists,
		which checks, whether a dialog exist, and if so, shows, raises
		it and returns. The variable should be global or static. At the
		end of dialog another function should be called:
		show_nice_dialog. Why nice? First, it shows the dialog. Next, it
		sets wmclass for it, and finally, an icon.
	* dialogs.c,about.c,prefs.c: according to above improvement, made almost
		all dialogs to use this. So, lots of code was removed and it
		looks nicer. Of course, all dialogs have icons, class, parents;
		may be created only once at a time, after closing they are
		destroyed, and raised if were just obscured.
	* prefs.*: moved widgets from prefs.h to prefs.c as they are not useful
		for anything outside this file. Replaced (gpointer)1 with
			GINT_TO_POINTER.
	* about.[ch]: left only one callback declared here -- about_box. Added
		myself to authors, I think I deserve it ;) Removed the "Now you
		can't see much..." from description, because it works quite
		well. well...
	* parse.c: removed the code which calls usleep. What the hell needs it.
		Instead I changed the status message so that we need only one.
		However, left it in configure.in...
	* *.h: removed lots of unused #include's.
	* TODO: added lots of ideas.

2000-07-21  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gtr_dialogs.[ch]: further gnomefying of dialogs: goto. Related to
		this removal of all g_dlg* global variables and functions,
		leaving only one: goto_dlg, and a callback for it --
		goto_dlg_clicked. Also removed msg_pair_count variable.  GoTo
		dialog now displays current message number when shown.  Made
		*dialog widgets in these three functions static, connected
		signals to make them NULL when destroyed, and first check, if
		the dialog is already created -- then just show it.
	* gui.c: added some ...'s for menu entries, added goto menu entry,
		and callbacks for it, back and next, also changed
		disable/enable_buttons for this.

2000-07-21  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* parse.[ch]: added functions: update_message, save_the_file,
		write_the_message, restore_msg, the latter being quite long.
		They implement writing messages to a file. update_message
		writes the text, if it was changed (a new variable
		message_changed), from trans_box to msgstr. This made
		gtranslator a real and useful apllication.
	* gtr_dialogs.[ch]: removed the uneeded global variables and lots of
		functions, related to save/open dialogs. There was crap...
		No made to function properly, save as now works. A "save as"
		copy of unchanged file is indentical to the original.

2000-07-20  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* Today I consider parsing to be finished. It works!
	* gtr_dialogs.c: replaced a bunch of gtk_widget_show with one
		gtk_widget_show_all, also made the dialog transient
		(g_dlg_create). Still need to do the same for other dialogs.
	* gtr_dialogs.c: corrected the Cancel button to destroy the goto dialog,
		and Go! button to actually work.
	* parse.c: added get_nth_msg for use in goto dialog and convenience
		function reached_middle_msg for enabling buttons. Also:
		added get_msg_status(gtr_msg *) for updating the message status
		with a very simple check. append_line(gchar **, gchar *),
		which formats the message enclosed in "'s and adds it to the
		first string. So messages are displayed nice... Almost.
		Fixed cleaning the boxes when text inside was edited.
		Completely rewrote the parse function, now I do not remember
		what was there before...
	* parse.h: according to parse.c, changed and reformatted the header...
	* gui.c: moved options button just before Exit, wrapped moving buttons
		with separators. Made text1 not editable (really in parse.c).

2000-07-18  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>
	
	* parse.[ch]: totally rewritten the parse() function -- now reads
		messages almost correctly (additional characters, something
		wrong with the line buffer). the header now is got as the first
		message pair, but ignored. Written reached_first_msg and
		reached_last_msg functions for changing the button status.
		Moved the stuff for displaying a message to display_msg
		function. Cleaned up get_****_msg due to above changes.
		Completely removed msg_pair variable, instead added cur_msg --
		a pointer to current message. Added get_msg_status function
		for getting and adjusting the translating status.
	* After all of these changes messages got displayed and
		first/prev/next/last buttons started to work! (What was a goal
		for 0.20, eh?)
	* Have read 64% of this file (till 200-05-24)... Uh...

2000-07-17  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>
	
	* changed all sprintf calls to GLib ones.
	* header_stuff.[ch]: written the get_header and free_header functions
	* parse.c: beginning to change parse() function to work properly
	* messages.h: some comments about places which need change
	* msg_db.c: free the msg_db string (close_msg_db)
	* gui.c: Replaced those crazy gtk_widget_show() with one call at the
		end... Also added a free_header(ph); call in gtranslator_quit

2000-07-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>
	
	* parse.c: Removed the one debug message and the
		corresponding ifdefs.
	
	* main.c: Call the intl-domain of POPT before showing
		the options.
		[ So we're now getting internationalized help
		   messages :) ]

2000-07-12  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* msg_db.c: Return a `0' not `NULL' if the challenge
		length cannot be send.
	
	* Makefile.am: Added these two files to the sources.
	
	* find.c & find.h: Added the files for the find routines.

	* \*.c: Removed the last rests of these `//' C++
		comments in these C source files.

	* Makefile.am: Added the G_LOG_DOMAIN define for the build
		of gtranslator.

2000-07-06  Fatih Demir	 <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* header_stuff.c: Use the existing static gtr_header and don't
		allocate, assign etc. the values and structures; don't
		 use these long if-trees.

	* gui.c: Bloat this menu with stock pixmaps.

	* gui.c: Extended the menus with a real messages status
		menu tree which represents the possible stati of
		 a message entry.
	
	* gui.c: Adding another menu-subtree from where you can
		define the msg_status field of every message.
		[ Only foo'ish for now .... ]
	
	* gtr_dialogs.c: Get the challenge-length from the Spinbutton
		for querying the messages db.
	
	* main.c: Corrected a typo at the `--challenge-length'
		option.

2000-07-04  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* gui.c: Disable the corresponding menu entries
		also if no file is open.
	
	* main.c: Added another option to specify the
		desired minimun match length ( aka.
 	 	 challenge length); perform a little
		  check before applying the default
		   challenge length;
		    set the default challenge length to 2.
	
	* msg_db.c: Two new routines which are setting the
		challenge length ( the length of the
		 strncasecmp-calls while retrieving the
 		  results for the query. ).
	
	* msg_db.h: Added the variable and the two prototypes for
		the new functions and the new variable.

2000-06-30  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* msg_db.c: Added the size returning function for
		the messages db handling.
	
	* header_stuff.c: Removed the free/malloc stuff from the
		header routines.

2000-06-14  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* .cvsignore: Removed dummy.po from the repo and from
		the .cvsignore.
	
	* header_stuff.c: Do the same again like weeks before,
		fill up the structure.

2000-06-12  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* header_stuff.c: Removed the ifdef for the header routines.
		started to work on `real'( TM ;) ) header routines.
		 get the message only then to the list if it's a
		  msg-block.
		   [ I love this font-shadowing from Eterm,
		     my CPU doesn't but that's another point.]
	
	* parse.c: Hmm, do some more widget work.

2000-06-11  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse.c: Take the string length of the temp_char
		as array length; ise two gchar's for the
		 operations (removed the "zamane" gchar.).

2000-06-10  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>
 
	* parse.c: Use a generally fresh allocated gchar for
		the parsing routines; corrected a typo.

        * main.c: Make the output of '-q' on the cmd-line

	* EURO 2000 >)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)

	* Set the gtr_msg_status field according to
	
		the msgid; that's not the most perfect way
	
		to do it, but it seemed possible to me.

	* Use some woohoo to do the strip-off.

	* Rip the msgid and the msgstr clearly from
	
		the gchar.
	
		-> parse.c

	* Don't free the gchar as it's still used.
	
	* Made the mentioned gchar not allocated.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c

2000-06-09  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Highlight the main window during a drop.
	
		-> gui.c

	* Set the window properties and again use
	
		the window-icon if possible.
	
	* Adding the query dialog, the widgets

	* Use g_strconcat rather than strcat.

	* Implemented the ( hopefully ) good

	* Remvoed the final gboolean; it has been
	
		replaced by three other gboolean which
	
		are also usefull for the recognition of
	
		multi-line translations.

		case.
	
	* Removed the ifdef, so we can now again
	
		watch gtranslator crashing...
	
		-> parse.c
	
	* Reverted to the old mechanism.
	
		-> header_stuff.c

	* Adjust the dialog size.

	* Create a table holding the widgets for the
	
		Find-dialog.
	
	* You can only "goto" till the last entry of
	
		the list, so carry it as an argument to the
	
		core-function.
	
	* Fill out the find dialogs.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c

	* Made some text-output non-translatable, e.g. the '\n''s.

		more work for the translators.. ;)

	* Made the option working and restructured the init a
	
		bit.
	
	* Quit after the query before any GUI-element is loaded.
	
	* Print the query & the result.

	* Added a for-the-moment dummy option '-q' / '--query'
	
		which will be used to query the msg_db for entries
	
		without starting the whole GUI. Possibly ...
	
		-> main.c

2000-06-03  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Make first a check if it exists yet, and
	
		it it doesn't exist, print a message and open
	
		it with creation flags.

	* Create the msg_db, if necessary.
	
		-> msg_db.c

	* Set the window-icon in every popup-dialog.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c

2000-06-01  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>
	
	* The same for the header-routines.
	
		-> header_stuff.c

	* Recognized the most stupid error in

		the parse code.
	
	* Copy the strings, don't assign them!
	
		-> parse.c

2000-05-30  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Use a temporary gchar* as a bridging
	
		variable for the msg_db location.

	* Removed the "hard-coded" msg_db stuff.
	
		-> msg_db.c/h

	* Removed the MSG_DB definition as it's
	
		now made more pratically with an option
	
		or in the user's dir.
	
		-> Makefile.am

	* Print out a string-based error message
	
		and not only the error number which isn't
	
		quite useful.
	
		-> parse.c

	* Set the widget sizes to be more nice, as we
	
		surely want to be able to read the mini-window
	
		titles without resizing.

	* Added a basic search dialog which is really
	
		poor in this state.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c/h

	* Show a little message before doing the quit.

	* Connected the additional signals for the
	
		find dialog.

	* Added another button to the search-bar; an
	
		`Add'-button which adds the current message
	
		pair to the msg_db.

	* Connect the corresponding function with the
	
		button.

	* Free the freshly allocated gchar's.

	* Added another function which is a callback
	
		function in between adding the entries to
	
		the msg_db and the corresponding button.
	
	* Close the msg_db on quit, if the msg_db has
	
		been inited/opened.
	
		-> interface.c

	* Check for the msg_db option and do some checks.

        +       Init the crappy-but-self-written
 
                msg_db-routines on startup.
 
                -> main.c

2000-05-28  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>

                and into the vbox.

        +       Added a check-button which lets you use
 
                your personal options defined in the Preferences
 
                section to fill out the header.

	* Moved some variable declarations around.

		if this is wished.
	
	* Read & write the geometry definitions.
	
		-> prefs.c/h

	* Set the geometry  from the prefs &
	
		the stored place.
	
	* Read the stored geometry defitions.

		-> main.c
	
	* Made the Gtk+ entry-boxes to GNOME
	
		entry-boxes and added a table holding
	
		all the nice entry-boxes and the labels.

	* Adding the first entry-boxes which
	
		are holding the parsed informations.
	
		-> header_stuff.c
	
	* Removed another crash reason; the check
	
		for the filename is now only done by an
	
		assertation (!=NULL), nothing more.

	* Make the Goto button also sensitive;
	
		disable it if no po-file is opened.
	
		-> interface.c

2000-05-25  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* -----------------------------------
	
	* Moved the static gtr_header to the header.
	
		-> header_stuff.c/h

	* Assign the strings via g_strdup().

	* Make the structure be a structure-pointer.

	* Removed the X-Generator header information
	
		field from the structure and the header-
	
		parsing routine.
	
		-> header_stuff.c/h

	* Ha, another crash again...

	* Thinking about the removal of some seem-
	
		to-be unnecessary includes.
	
		-> *.h

	* Removed the pf-structure as it seems to
	
		be useless.
	
	* Introduced another static gchar -- the
	
		filename.
	
	* Making the parse-routine again produce
	
		dozains of structure's.
	
		-> parse.c
	
2000-05-21  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Doing all the if's and cut's for the
	
		header and filled the informations into
	
		the header_structure.

	* Create a structure which holds all
	
		these informations.
	
	* Added some debug-g_print's.

	* Put the header-cutting routine(s) in
	
		the header_stuff and while parsing the
	
		file, gtranslator calls only this function.

		-> header_stuff.c/h
	
	* Removed the [c]-things and will try
	
		it again with GLists.

		-> parse.c
