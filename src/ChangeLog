2001-03-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* stylistics.c: Hm, don't free up the now simply given color value
		paths.

	* prefs_init.c: Changed the initial color values according to the
		new color value path.

	* gui.c & stylistics.c: Split up the color setting locations to "fg/bg"
		for color schemes and "own_fg/own_bg" for the GnomeColorPickers
		 to avoid very nice and immenant black color values.

	* gui.c: Insert a separator between the toolbar icons/menu items
		for navigating to first/back and next/last message and also
		 implemented an own keyhandler which now receives the Ctrl+
		  Left/Right and Ctrl+Up/Down keys which are the new keyboard
		   shortcuts for the navigation.
	
	* prefs.c: Added scheme definition GnomeFileEntry and the stuff around
		in the preferences box and entries; reinit the colors after
		 a color scheme change on the fly.

2001-03-02  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Hmm, check status before freeing it -- it could also not be
		used by the update_appbar function, so that we free up a
		 not used gchar -- another crash less.

	* color-schemes.c: Only add the GtrColorSchemeInformations structure
		if the structure is complete and non-NULL and sort the list
		 via strcmp before returning it - hmm, leak hunting: changed
		  much stuff to NOT cause memleaks.

	* prefs_init.c: Arg, blue is nicer then navy for hotkeys, reverted my 
		change from yesterday.

	* main.c: If a color scheme/theme is given on the comman line take it
		as our syntax color scheme -- at least we do try it .-)

	* stylistics.c: Use the new color scheme based color selection.

	* color-schemes.c/.h: Implemented the new 
		"gtranslator_color_scheme_load_from_prefs" function which
		  restores the stored GtrColorScheme from the preferences
		   "back" as the current theme; also allow spaces around the
		     color names in the color schemes as we do now strip out
		      the spaces.

	* sidebar.c: Check if there's any msgstr data before using strcmp
		-- avoids a nasty crash.

2001-03-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* sighandling.c: Initialize the gint outside the signal handler.

	* color-schemes.c/.h: Added own free_color_scheme(_info) functions
		which do free the used structures and implemented all
		 functions for now.

	* Makefile.am: Define SCHEMESDIR on compiletime to be 
		$(datadir)/gtranslator/colorschemes.

	* stylistics.c/.h: Extended the copyright header line and
		renamed the VALUE_DOT_CHAR etc. all to VALUE_SPECIAL_CHAR
		 like in the preferences.

	* color-schemes.c: Got it working and parsing the given
		color schemes -- also check the given file if it's a gtranslator
		 color scheme at all.

	* prefs.h & prefs_init.c: Set up default syntax colors via the new 
		prefs_init_syntax_colors function and also declare this
		 new function in the header.

	* query.c: Fiddling around in language names & co.

	* parse.c, parse.h & parse_core.c: Outsourced the real parse routine
		into parse_core.c and named it parse_core -- this makes the
		 nautilus-gtranslator-view work again.

	* htmlizer.c: Also recognize newlines and convert them to <br>
		tags.

	* query.c/.h: Extended the function to take also a language
		parameter.

2001-02-28  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* color-schemes.c/h & sighandling.c/h: Corrected header copyright
		email address of mine.

	* query.c/.h: Added new query sources -- quite simple for now.

	* sighandling.c: Wrote a command line based part which will ask the
		the user now on the command line if we've got to save the file
		 and to do the save task before exiting.

	* Makefile.am: Include the new signal handling and query sources.

	* main.c: Bind the main signals to the new sources.

	* sighandling.c/h: Added preliminary signal handling sources
		which do only print out some messages .-)

	* open-differently.c: Added a comment to clarify the printf
		statement for the translators.

2001-02-27  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Added scheme option to define a color scheme at startup.

	* Makefile.am: Added the new files to the sources.

	* color-schemes.c/.h: Added these color scheme source files.

	* header_stuff.c/.h: Moved the prototype declarations for
		prepare_comment_for_view/save into the header.
	
2001-02-26  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gnome-regex.c & parse.c: Include config.h only if HAVE_CONFIG_H
		is defined.

2001-02-25  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* *.[ch]: #include shuffle to include only what's really needed.
	* gui.c: fix warning with translation of dot char.
	* open-differently.c, parse.c, sidebar.c: fix that stupid thing
	-- *never* initialize char * variables!
	* parse.h: remove percentage, and condition about regex, and
	get_translated_count.
	* pref*, stylistics*, syntax*:: save colors as "#00AA88" instead of
	three values. Use gdk_color_parse and color names. I have had the same
	as gtranslator_syntax_get_section_name, but in stylistics.c and with
	name get_path_from_type... left this one. Use array of GdkColors, not
	allocate them every time. In syntax use COLOR_ enums, not direct
	colors. and s/COLOR_VALUE_/COLOR_/ ...

2001-02-25  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* stylistics.c: Use the new function to determine the section names
		and prepare the customization of the highlight colors.

	* syntax.c/.h: Added a "gtranslator_syntax_get_section_name" function
		which returns the section name for the given ColorValueType.
	
	* dialogs.c: Removed the window-icon setting function really now.

2001-02-24  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Call the window icon setting function at the _right_ time
		just after having called gnome_init_with_popt_table.

	* Makefile.am: Properly define the USE_WINDOW_ICON define and flags
		to get the global window-icon set up.

	* prefs.c: Show up font informations on the preferences page rather
		then simply showing the font button.

	* stylistics.c: Removed the COLOR_VALUE_END_CHAR parts of the switch
		tree as it isn't used anymore/will not be used in the future.

	* stylistics.h: Added the new types which are also used as "classes"
		in the syntax highlighting code to easify the later 
		 customization of the syntax highlight colors and removed the
		  COLOR_VALUE_END_CHAR enum item as it'll never be used
		   (gtranslator automatically makes the end chars correctly).

	* parse.c: Check if there's any header before using any simple header
		comment while saving specially opened gettext po file; also
		 count the sticky messages as translated messages and renew the
		  status counts to avoid mess in the status -- a FIXME less.

	* gui.c: Changed the keybindings a bit; the header edit dialog is
		 also available via a F8 now and the message stati are also
		  toggleable via Alt+1/2/3 for Translated/Fuzzy/Stick.
		  
		 Also removed an commented statement which would be useless
		  if it would be used -- why leave it there...

	* dialogs.c & main.c: Set the default window icon from the main loop
		and don't do this again and again -- simply use a call of
		 gnome_window_icon_set_default_from_file.

	* open-differently.c/.h: Added functions for opening up bzip2'ed
		and compress'ed gettext po files and made the functions
		 known to the "detection" function "gtranslator_open_po_file".

	* dialogs.c & open-differently.c: Also recognize "hidden" ftp
		and https URI's.

2001-02-24  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* find.c: now find find's all occurences of a string in a message.
		Bug #51189

2001-02-23  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* .cvsignore: Added some newly files to the cvsignores (these
		are to be honest files related to build up a semi-static
		 gtranslator which does only need gnome-libs and gnome-print
		  and no gal etc. anymore).

	* dialogs.c: Initialize findMenu with 0 to avoid an error.

	* preferences.c/h, stylistics.c/h & vfs-handle.c/h: There's no
		libgtranslator anylonger, change accordingly all the
		 copyright headers and comments.

2001-02-21  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* history.c: Extended the copyright line as Gediminas did much
		work there.

2001-02-20  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* find.c: fixed bug #51172, where you can reach an endlessloop

2001-02-20  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* sidebar.c/.h: Changed the gtranslator_sidebar_add_po
		to gtranslator_sidebar_activate_views as there's no po
		 file data used directly in the sidebar.

	* syntax.c/.h & parse.c: Free up some variables and optimize some
		kind for memory leaks.
	
	* parse.c: Also enable the different views for a "non-saveable"
		file.

	* update.c: Also added the "no good" case to the results matching
		-- or we are getting always successful updates.

	* header_stuff.c: Also convert the header comment back in case of
		no edit of the header edit dialog.

	* gui.c: Made a dot/special char also gettexted for solving some
		problems on "more special" characters sets and implemented
		 more checks for the text position.

	* syntax.c: Used a macro instead tons of the g_string_append_c
		call, makes the source better to read and put the Gtk+
		 position routines calls into the right order, so that the
		  syntax update now works as wished.

	* about.c, find.c: Fixed only cosmetical aspects.

	* vfs-handle.c: Made the routines use a GString, handling of
		relative filenames/filepaths is also done now and the
		 useless switch at the end is now also removed.

2001-02-20  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* find.c,find.h: Enhanced the find function.

2001-02-20  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* about.c: Added Thomas .-)

2001-02-19  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* vfs-handle.c: Fixed the local access routine, it should work
		now -- it does also work with relative paths.

	* gui.c: Hm, don't set the position not without testing the real
		index relations to the text widget.

	* syntax.c: Freeze/thaw up the text widgets before doing a complete
		syntax update.

	* dialogs.c: Reimplemented the Open from URI dialog and made it
		more simple this time -- the protocol checks are still
		 present though and a nice and small label is now also
		  there.

2001-02-18  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Made the comments box bigger and implemented 2
		functions which do prepare the header comment for view/edit
		 and save -- the header edit dialog displays now only the
		  comment without any # or free spaces.

	* gui.c: Hm, removed the "textlen" variable and connected stuff and
		reverted to old mechanism with gtranslator_syntax_update_text.

	* syntax.c: Added "@" to the syntax highlighted characters.

	* gui.c: The syntax highlighting does now work instantly without
		the gtranslator_syntax_update_text function so it doesn't
		 flicker any more.

	* dialogs.c, dialogs.h & gui.c: Added open from URI menu entry
		and added the logic around it -- it works.

	* ChangeLog: Changed Thomas' email address also here ,-)

2001-02-17  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c, find.h, find.c: strings are now found in the right
		categorie.

2001-02-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs_init.c & Makefile.am: Added this source file which does the
		1st time initialization for the most important preferences
		 items.

	* sidebar.c: Fixed #51000, the text gets now stored if the user
		changes the view.

	* gui.c: Rehighlight the complete widget after pasting something
		into the translation box.

2001-02-17  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* syntax.c: refactoring of the code

2001-02-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c & syntax.c/.h: Added a "gtranslator_syntax_update_text"
		function which updates the given text widgets highlighting
		 and made it work immediately as you type.

	* syntax.c/htmlizer.c: Don't show assertion errors on untranslated
		messages as the msgstr is in this case empty -- avoid this
		 with conditionals.

	* dnd.c: Also use the new syntax enhanced text insertion method.

	* sidebar.c: Use the new "gtranslator_syntax_insert_text" method to
		also highlight comments.

	* syntax.c: Implemented color routine and made the syntax highlighting
		task -- it works great ,-)
	
	* gui.c: Use the new syntax routines to insert text instead of the old
		"gtk_text_insert" calls.

	* Makefile.am: Added syntax.c/.h to the sources.

	* syntax.c/.h: Added these syntax sources which will hold the
		syntax highlighting for gtranslator.

	* dialogs.c: Added search possibility for comments.

	* find.c: Also search for comments if wished via the find dialog.

	* \*.c: Changed also all the includes according to the move.

	* Makefile.am, shortcutbar.c/.h & sidebar.c/.h: Moved the sidebar
		sources to a more logical filename (sidebar.c/.h).

	* .cvsignore: Added the .sources backup dir of my own.

2001-02-16  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* shortcutbar.c: Added a function which shows an existing
		comment or displays an information message to the user
		 and removed all editable comments stuff -- why should
		  comments be editable on a per-message base?!

	* htmlizer.c: Corrected a small output error (do not also mark
		the brackets as links).

2001-02-15  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Make the header edit dialog resizable in growth
		direction -- no shrink allowed.

	* open-differently.c/.h: Moved the includes into the source file.

	* messages.h: Removed unused GList msgstr_list.

	* parse.c: Clear the sidebar via the new function if we do close
		a file.

	* shortcutbar.c/.h: Added the "gtranslator_sidebar_clean" function
		which clears the sidebar and corrected the comments showing
		 routine which does now really show you the message written
		  down in the source, if there's no comment for the current
		   message.

2001-02-14  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* preferences.h, vfs-handle.h & messages.h: Changed the include
		directives to use the gtranslator prefix "GTR" instead of
		 the old "LIBGTRANSLATOR" prefix.

	* main.c: Added an option to use the htmlizer functions and
		it works, works and works..

	* htmlizer.h/.c: Some reorganization, added recognition of %lx format
		arguments and added file output stuf around it.

	* gui.c: Do not include htmlizer.h -- we don't use it ever in
		gui.c.

	* history.c: Set the maximal number of history entries to
		10 for now.

	* shortcutbar.c: Remove the temporary header call & icon;
		implemented some kinds of views with the help of the
		 current GUI. Comments can get displayed now instead of
		  the msgid.

2001-02-13  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Made all conditional inclusion of GnomeVFS sources
		and functions normal used sources. Less ifdef/endifs.

	* Makefile.am: Added vfs sources generally, deleted not
		needed checks and XML flags.

	* open-differently.c: Also pass the local "file:/" URIs to
		GnomeVFS methods and use strcmp instead of g_strncasecmp.

2001-02-12  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* shortcutbar.c: Do not intend that we do have a MDI with "Files:";
		use "Views:" instead.

	* parse.c: Corrected a typo; successfull->successful.

2001-02-11  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am & gui.c: Removed any gtkhtml routines; we do not use
		gtkhtml anylonger.

	* about.c: Added the Free Software Foundation copyright; when did
		this disappear?!

2001-02-10  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* shortcutbar.c: Check for the filename before doing anything.

2001-02-09  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* htmlizer.c: Added string.h as an include as suggested by
		Josh Jackson, moved the "'" char to the quotation char
		 group again and added two new word classes for GNU and
		  GNOME words.

	* about.c: Changed the about messages as we don't have got any
		libgtranslator/gtranslatord anylonger.

	* *.c/.h: Moved the preferences.h header to prefs.h and all the files
		needing it include it from there already.

	* vfs-handle.c/.h & messages.h: Moved these files from libgtranslator
		to here.

	* Makefile.am: Don't link against libgtranslator because it isn't
	 	existent any longer -- removed the cflags and flags for it
		 and added the vfs handle sources and the message.h file to
		  the sources.

	* session.c, prefs.c, gui.c, history.c, dialogs.c & main.c:
		Changed the include dirs to be local as libgtranslator
		 is dead now.

	* parse.c, gui.c, prefs.c & history.c: Applied the
		changes from Gediminas for stable also to HEAD.

	* Makefile.am: Do link against the new static library in
		libgtranslator, add all the new sources.
	
	* preferences.c/.h: Moved from libgtranslator to here.

	* stylistics.c/.h: Moved also to here and included the
		gnome-i18n.h header for problemless build.

2001-02-08  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Made GAL & GtkHTML flags used by default.

	* parse.c & gui.c: Made all conditional uses of GAL & GtkHTML
		use the enhanced GAL & GtkHTML actions by default as they're
		 now requirements for HEAD.

2001-02-06  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* shortcutbar.c: Don't show the full filename in the shortcut bar;
		just show the project name and the base filename.

2001-02-05  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: open working dir in save as dialog also.
	* header_stuff.c: if no project version is set do not write space after
	name ;). Fixed stupid error with \n in comment.
	* history.c: implement "Check if the file exists" option. Save only
	8 entries.
	* parse.c: in file open callback, close old file before opening new.
	Implement "warn user about fuzzy mesages left" option.
	* prefs.c: do not free internal font name.

2001-02-04  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: Open dialog shows the same dir as current file.
	* parse.c: avoid crash in free_po() if po=NULL.
	
2001-02-04  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: get not-localized language only from language
	name, not from other fields. Fix a crash. Ensure comment ends with \n.
	* history.c: show nice menu items: 1. project 3.14 -- lt.po. Install
	menu hints into appbar.

2001-02-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c, gui.h, parse.c: Removed the locally defined
		shortcut bar stuff as we do now have general
		 handles for it in shortcutbar.c/.h.

	* Makefile.am: Integrate the new sources conditionally.

	* shortcutbar.c/.h: New sources for shortcut bar stuff.

2001-02-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* open-differently.c: Corrected the opening of the "special"
		po files -- don't forget the GnomeVFS case.

	* gui.c: Added crusty shortcut bar stuff and added a default
		"Files" group which should always be present.

	* parse.c: Also create a shortcut bar entry for the po file
		-- just cosmetic for now.

	* gui.h: Define the globally used EShortcutModel and include
		the corresponding gal header already there.

	* htmlizer.c: Changed the color of quote characters also
		to red.

	* gui.c: Added some gal parts like an e-vpaned and a
		shortcut bar which is empty for now -- all is
		 conditionally defined -- no gal, no e-vpaned etc.

	* Makefile.am: Added gal cflags/libs conditionals.

	* gui.c: Also disable editing of the GtkHTML msgid display.

	* history.c/.h: Added Gediminas to the authors line .-)

	* history.c: Removed a g_print.

2001-02-03  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* history.c: renamed "history_length" to "history/length" for
	gnome-config. When reading, append to list, so newest entries are
	always at top. History works with gnome-config now. Not yet with
	gconf...

2001-02-03  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	Almost fixed history stuff.
	* gui.c, parse.*, history.*: renamed gtranslator_display_recent() to
	gtranslator_history_show() and moved from parse* to history*. the same
	with parse_the_file_from_the_recent_files_list() ->
	open_file_from_history().
	* history.c: removed lots of fake variable initializers and leaks ;).
	Replaced gtranslator_history_assort with remove_duplicate_entries, which
	removes duplicates of one entry, used only on history_add.
	* Makefile.am: build ./ before pixmaps/.

2001-02-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* pixmaps/.cvsignore: Added cvs ignore again for HEAD.

	* gui.c: Use the new htmlizer code and gtkhtml for the msgid
		part if we're working with gtkhtml -- this is like a
		 preview for the further work for the msgstr part.

2001-02-02  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* htmlizer.c/.h: Added html making helper sources; very
		simple though.

	* Makefile.am: Added GtkHTML flags for building linking and
		the new htmlizer.c/.h sources to the build.

	* main.c: Changed the <libgtranslator/parse-db.h> include to
		<libgtranslator/libgtranslator.h>.

	* gui.c: Changed the webaddress to http://www.gtranslator.org

2001-02-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: Perhaps the Save as dialog will also detect
		a previously remote po file and will offer a direct
		 save as filename.

	* gui.c & parse.c: Also disable the Save button for the
		"remotely" copied po files.

	* open-differently.c: Made the remote stuff finally really
		work for all supported kinds of po files; take the
		 local copy of the remote file as the 'local' file.

2001-01-31  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* open-differently.c: Also use the VFS methods to open
		a remote po file via GnomeVFS -- if present.
	
	* parse.c: Moved the check for file existence before the check
		for read/write permissions.

2001-01-30  Simos Xenitellis  <simos@hellug.gr>

	* languages.h: Added entry for the Greek language.

2001-01-30  Thomas Ziehmer <thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* history.c, parse.c: fixed list bugs, which generated segv.

2001-01-29  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Use the new history functions <damn-it/>.

	* .cvsignore: Add ".gdbinit" to the ignores.

	* Makefile.am: Added the new history sources and reordered the
		source files alphabetically.

	* parse.c: Removed all core stuff for the recent files/history.

	* history.c/.h: New history sources.

2001-01-28  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Changed a hotkey to work (it's the "Message status"
		menu entry).

2001-01-27  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Get the language name from the languages
		list and don't write localized language names to the
		 po files.

	* parse.c: If the po file header does still have got the
		default values, on startup the "Edit Header" dialog
		 will now pop up to make it possible to change the
		  header fields to the corresponding values.

	* parse.c & parse.h: New history/recent files stuff which
		is now gtranslator_config_* based; could work in
		 the next time.

	* gui.c & parse.c: Don't enable the save buttons if the
		user doesn't have got direct write permissions.

	* dialogs.c: More write protection detection; save file
		as dialog is now more enhanced for perms.

	* parse.c/.h: Don't write immediately if the user
		doesn't have got write permissions on the
		 po file -- detect this permission while
		  parsing the po file.
	

	* gui.c, prefs.h & prefs.c: Removed all multiple dot
		char stuff and reverted to the old dot char
		 stuff -- but the "dot char" is now also
		  "gettexted", so that it should also be usable
		    with Japanese/Ukrainian charsets.

2001-01-24  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Fiddling with the new multiple dot char stuff.

	* prefs.c/.h: Added multiple dot char selection.

	* pixmaps/.cvsignore: Added this delirium for pixmaps .-)

	* Makefile.am, pixmaps/Makefile.am: Outsourced the
		pixmaps Makefile targets.

	* \*.\*: Set the years of development also to
		2001.
	
	* parse.c/.h: Added a function to check the access perms
		for the po files.
	
	* about.c: Changed the copyright years.

2001-01-21  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* languages.h: Updated and corrected the Turkish
		mailing list address.

2001-01-14  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Removed the open-po-file-*.c/.h
		sources.
	
	* open-po-file-*.c/.h: Removed these source files.

2001-01-14  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

2001-01-12  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Removed the recent-files.h inclusion.

2001-01-11  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

		toolbar button.
	* gui.c: use it. Fixed ispell command constructing.
	* header_stuff.c: reformatted *'s
	* parse.c: removed some checks and leaks. Rewritten
		gtranslator_display_recent completely, now works.
	* prefs.c: load/save dictionary entry. Made it simple entry, because it
	does not need to be a file, just name.
	* prefs.h: whitespace.

2001-01-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Added code which determines if a special dictionary

		ispell process of gtkspell.

	* prefs.h, parse.c: Removed the recent files entries from the

2001-01-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* open-differently.c: Applied the change of the temporary file name
		to "gtranslator-temp-po-file".

	* update.c: Changed the script name also in the comments.

	* parse.c: Delete the temporary file after saving the messages to
		a new file, build the right name for the files, changed
		 the name of the temporary file to "gtranslator-temp-po-file"
		  and made it also possible to open gzip'ed and compiled
		   gettext po files from the GUI via the open dialog and the
		    recent files list; don't take the temporary files into
		     the recent files list.
	
	* parse.c/.h, languages.h, header-stuff.c/.h, gui.c/.h: Reformatted
		these files simply.

	not remember orig_mouse.
	* gui.c/.h: moved create_popup_menu declaration from .h to .c. Moved
	check if popup menu is enabled to top -- create a menu only i needed,
	always destroy it. Changed type of function to match prototype, return
	FALSE/TRUE.

2001-01-03  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gtkspell.c: (popup menu) fixed tests for which button is pressed and
	when to popup spelling menu. Now works with/without popup menu. Merged
	duplicated blocks.
	removed extra whitespace and replaced some spaces with tabs.

2001-01-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* open-differently.c/.h: Added a method which detects
		and returns TRUE if the "special" methods of
		 gtranslator can open the detected suffixes.

	* parse.c: Filter the new temporary file's name
		and try to save the file under a different

		on this file.

	* about.c/.h, find.c/.h, dialogs.c/.h & dnd.c/.h:
	        Reformatted these files.

	* gtkspell.c: Changed the mouse button on which
		the gtkspell suggestion list reacts from
		 the right one (which is already used by the
		  eventually enabled pop up menu) to the
		   middle one (this is only conditional; if the
		    po-pup menu is disabled, it's still on the
		     right mouse button).

	* session.c/.h: Reformatted the comments.

	* gtkspell.h: Change the #ifndef/define pair for the
		header.

	* prefs.h, prefs.c: Reformatted the files and added
		the necessary parts for the spell checking page.

		  according to the preferences.

	* spell.c/.h: Removed these old some files.

	* Makefile.am: Removed spell.c/.h from the sources.

	* prefs.c: Show the notebook tabs on the

	* gui.c: Fix memory leak in update_appbar (str was not freed).
	change status logic a bit, to make it simpler.
	* prefs.c: fix size of sixth page table. check if font is saved in
	preferences, only then set it.
	
2000-12-29  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Include the new files altogether in a build,
		removed the "SophInterfaceFiles" from the EXTRA_DIST
		 and it's targetism.

2000-12-28  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Include also the open-po-file-dialog sources.

		  beginners' druid in the build.
	
	* beginners-druid-*.c/h, open-po-file-dialog-*.c/.h,
		preferences-dialog-*.c/.h: Added the C sources for
		 the previous glade files -- need tuning and coding
		  here -- they'ren't included in the build for now.

2000-12-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Disable the Spell checking menu entries on startup.

2000-12-15  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: if there were no comments, do not print (null).
	* gui.c: do not replace dots with spaces, exchange them! So now dots are
	not lost, they just look like spaces. (in show-centered-dot mode).

2000-12-09  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Hmm, stupid error... Forgot to write the else
		part of the condition if the filename if "temp_po_file";
		 now the save part should again work...

2000-12-08  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c/.h: Added a gtranslator_open_gzipped_po_file function
		which does work like gtranslator_open_mo_file but it does
		 it's job for a gzip'ed po-file.

	* main.c: Also open up gmo-files as they're the same as
		mo-files and do use the same plain stuff for gzip'ed
		 po-files as for mo-files .. without using GnomeVFS.

	* parse.c: Also allow opening mo/gmo-files from the open file
		dialog.

2000-12-07  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: (str_replace) added function which quickly replaces dots with
	spaces.
	Moved NONE declaration into function to avoid misuse.
	(display_msg, update_msg) substitute spaces with dots in temp variable,
	leave msg clean. msgid is never altered. Removed unneeded check if
	string is blank.
	(update_appbar) do NOT put anything else than ACT_... in call to
	disable_actions!
	(text_has_got_changed) optimize a lot drawing with dots. Redraw not
	all the text, only spaces :) set nothing_changes = TRUE when changing
	anything. Do NOT initialize variables with empty values! Free newstr (a
	GREAT leak).
	* parse.c: (parse) fix disable_actions. Do not activate trans_box.
	(restore_msg) removed dot char stuff, it is handled elsewhere.
	(write_the_message) ditto.
	(determine_translation_status) ditto.
	(undotchar) removed function.
	(update) do not initialize empty string. Always close file before
	updating and restore it later. Free strings.
	(gtranslator_open_mo_file) ditto.
	Removed not useful comments and checks for existence of surely allocated
	strings.
	* parse.h: removed undotchar declaration.

2000-12-06  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Determine if the given file has got
		the suffix ".mo" and open it with the
		 new function.

	* parse.c/.h: Added the a new function
		( gtranslator_open_mo_file ), which opens up
		   a mo-file ( the compiled gettext files )
		    by calling msgunfmt and teeing it's output
		     to a temporary file...
		Changed the arguments of a file from being
		 "const char *" to "const gchar *", added a
		  saving part for the mo-file function which
		   gets it's informations from the "temp_po_file"
		    name which should only be used temporarily.

2000-12-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Added more VFS stuff, so it
		tries to get the file via GnomeVFS
		 interface...

2000-12-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Added the conditional close-down of
		GnomeVFS if USE_VFS_STUFF is defined and
		 already running.
	
	* main.c: Added some kind of magic to use the new
		GnomeVFS based function from libgtranslator.

	* gtkspell.h: Made the ispell_cmd non-static,
		avoids a warning.
	
	* Makefile.am: Added the VFS cflags and libs
		stuff.

2000-12-02  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Enable the spell-checking menu entry.

	* Makefile.am: Added the new gtkspell.c/.h files.

	* gtkspell.c/.h: Copied these files from gnomeicu ,-)

2000-12-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Corrected a typo :-)

2000-11-27  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: do not free the result of g_basename(); do not crash.
	* gui.*: added ACT_NULL, a FIXME and warning. It is disabled somehow!

2000-11-18  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: grouped toolbar operations into file/po-specific/app groups.
	* parse.c: (parse) do not crash even if filename is a dir, NULL or "".

2000-11-13 Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c, find.c: implement "Find in", now you can search in English
	and/or translated entries.

2000-11-13 Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c, gui.c, header_stuff.c, prefs.c, session.c: call
	gtranslator_config_init/close (no more called inside of
	gtranslator_config_*).

2000-11-12  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Prevent gtranslator from crashing
		if there aren't any previous files.

	* Makefile.am: Added the LIBGLADE_LIBS to the
		libraries and changed the SCRIPTSDIR to
		 <gtranslator data>/scritps to fit the
		  data Makefiles.

2000-10-30  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Removed the include-dir ../libgtranslator as
		all libgtranslator headers are now globally declared
		 and the $top_srcdir include-dir is enough for this.
	
	* main.c: Also made it include only the <libgtranslator/...>
		headers instead of simply doing "...".

2000-10-30 Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: moved Update menu item just after Compile. Enable Status/Fuzzy
		menu entry after Open. Focus translation box during startup.
		Fixed some initialization of variables.
	* gui.c, parse.c: fixed various places where messages were counted.
		Removed extra update_appbar calls. Use po->length instead of
		g_list_length(po->messages).
	* parse.c: made	determine_translation_status static.  Create menu path
		only once in gtranslator_display_recent. Initialize counts to 0
		in get_translated_count. Simplified percentage count, now shows
		correctly. Removed onepercent variable.

2000-10-29  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Change the corresponding calls to the gtranslator_set_style
		function, as it does only take one argument now; call the
		 function twice, one time for the text box and one time
		  for the translation box.

2000-10-25  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.h, parse.h & spell.c: Changed the includes
		to <libgtranslator/messages.h> due to the move.
	
	* messages.h: Removed it from here. Moved it to libgtranslator.

2000-10-23  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Also added here the "/usr/X11R6/lib" to the
		$LDFLAGS for gtranslator; the source packages should
		 now again build without problems.

2000-10-20  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Also disable the corresponding buttons if no fuzzy/
		untranslated messages seem to have been residential
		 in the po-file.

	* parse.c: Corrected the place of the decrementing statement
		for the translated count.

2000-10-18  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c/h: Added another function which sets up the progress bar
		status ( gtranslator_set_progress_bar() ).
	
	* parse.c: Use this new function for the progress bar setting routines
		now, disable the "Fuzzy", "Untranslated" buttons on the parse
		 start and enable them only if there's a fuzzy, untranslated
		  message. Another bug has been removed :-)

2000-10-17  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Set the left fuzzy/untranslated messages inside the status
		text and set the progress bar corresponding to the current
		 status and hopefully update the fuzzy count in the status
		  messages and the untranslated messages count is now
		   updated somehow working =?

	* parse.c: Get the count at the startup and set the progress bar
		corresponding to the values ( also get the fuzzy count );
		 on closure of the file set the progress bar value to 0.

	* parse.h: do use "fuzzy" and "translated" fields for the determi-
		nition of the message status. Include two new functions
		 which should build the progress bar total and other sources
		  for status informations ( these are "get_translated_count"
		   for the list of messages and "determine_translation_status"
		    for the determination of the status itself ).
		Moved the two gfloat values to the header as they're globally
		 used now.

	* gui.c: Also have a progress bar in the GNOME appbar.

2000-10-15  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Set the font and the colors on startup via the new
		gtranslator_set_style() function which should do more
		 work but it's enough for now; include the new
		  "libgtranslator/stylistics.h" header for the function
		   gtranslator_set_style().

	* parse.c: Activate the translation box on the successful of a
		po-file.

	* prefs.h: Added the "font" gchar as part of the wants structure and
		added a function to set the style.

	* prefs.c: Use the new color getting/setting routines from
		libgtranslator, get/set the font name in the preferences and
		 the function to set the style.

2000-10-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: Removed the corresponding check button for the removed
		option and added a sixth page with the font and color
		 settings; added the widgets and labels for this, connected
		  the signals with the widgets and began to write the stuff
		   around this.

	* prefs.h: Removed the option to delete obsolete entries from the
		recent file menus and added the option to use own specs
		 for font and colors.

        * TODO.src: Removed it and added some points of it to the top level
                TODO file.
 
        * Makefile.am: Also removed the TODO.src file here.

2000-10-12  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: Changed the description text for the option to delete
		obsolete recent file menu entries as it does only remove
		 double entries following each other.

	* parse.c: Don't re-parse the file if no change would be applied
		to the po-file, inform the user about the not-existing
		 change; reverse the list of recent files as we're parsing
		  it reversely in our routine.

	* gui.c: Thaw up the translation text at the end of the process,
		get/set the pointer index by the gtk_editable_(g|s)et_position
		 functions, handle the translation text box as a GtkEditable;
		  now the dot char mode works as wished :-)

2000-10-11  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Call the gtranslator_display_recent() function every
		time a new file is opened; this function should now really
		 remove somehow all previous recent files entries from the
		  menus and insert the new ones and implemented the first
		   lines in direction to deleting obsolete multiple commons
		    of the same file.

	* gui.c: Also update the status bar information on changing the
		status from "Untranslated" to "Translated".

	* Makefile.am: Include the necessary GConf cflags for compiling
		and linking gtranslator.

	* gui.c: Solved the FIXME and "removed" the reverse writing
		"feature" of gtranslator :-)
		Wrong places for the freeze/thaw up calls of the GtkText,
		 this has been corrected and it works now again also in
		  dot char mode.

2000-10-07  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Removed the error warning about GConf as it works
		now again.

	* Makefile.am: Compiling and added the SCRIPTSDIR define to the
		 compile defines.

	* parse.c: Clean up the appbar when closing a file, wrote the
		update function which uses the "changed" update.sh script
		 from here to work; close the file before updating it and
		  open it then again.

	* gui.c: Freeze and thaw the translation box during updating
		the contents and delete all the characters in the
		 translation box forwardly, added a FIXME as it goes
		  to the index 0 though I want it to go somewhere else.
		Store the date via gtranslator_config_set_last_run_date()
		 on exit.

	* prefs.c: Changed the update policy of the GtkSpinButton to
		GTK_UPDATE_ALWAYS, added the toggle button for the new
		 toggle button and added another toggle button to switch
		  off these nice dialogs within the update function.
	
	* prefs.h: Added the delete_obsolete_rfentries value and the
		uzi_dialogs values to the wants structure.

2000-10-06  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* languages.h: Corrected the German mailing list address.

	* parse.c: Added an undotchar function which undotchars
		the texts _with_ regarding special cases like
		 quoting or special use with the ",',´ etc. chars.

	* parse.h: Added the prototype for the new parse_the_file
		function which is used from the "Recent files" menu.

	* parse.c: Use the new option to determine how many entries
		should go into this nice "Recent files" menu; added
		 hotkeys in front of the numbers, check for existence
		  of the file and call the corresponding new function
		   which is only intended to be used from this point
		    ( ->parse_the_file_from_recent_files_list ).

	* prefs.c: Added a fifth page with a GtkSpinButton with
		which you can define now how many recent files should
		 be in the "Recent files" menu and added an option
		  with which you can let gtranslator check every file
		   in the "Recent files" list for existence and if
		    it doesn't exist, then it isn't shown up in the
		     list.
		Perform two checks for the value of the recent files
		 number, if it's below 2 set it to 2 ( or it wouldn't
		  be named "Recent file_s_" :)).

	* prefs.h: Added the recent_files guint variable for the
		number of files wished to be in the Recent files
		 menu.

	* gui.c: Changed the pop up menu to show only the useful
		parts of itself, it's useful enough for now; the
		 "Recent" files menu is improved now for a better
		  style, no useless label widget and separator there
		   now.
	
	* parse.c: Changed the routines a bit, and added the option to
		set the number of entries hold in the Recent files menu
		( minimum 1, maximum 10 ).

2000-10-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Added "Recent files" sub menu into the File tree and
		put some dope stuff around it.

	* parse.c/h: Added Recent file menus on top of the libgnome's
		gnome_history interface. It works! Still needs
		 preferences merging...

	* parse.c/h: Added the update function's skeleton -- nothing
		real has been written yet.

	* prefs.c: Added another option to disable the update function
		as you need the original package sources for this
		 ( gtranslator will use the update.pl scripts in the
		    ./po-dir for this ) and as you need the sources.

	* gui.c: Added an "Update" button to the toolbar and to the
		menus; till now this hasn't got any use as the function
		 isn't written yet but that will happen soon....
		Enable/Disable this entry & button accordingly to the
		 option set in the preferences and to the case if a
		  file is opened or not.

2000-10-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Added more "live" status bar update for the status
		information on change of a fuzzy message, removed
		 the now obsolete FIXME entries and corrected some
		  wrong enable/disable actions.

	* parse.c: Check if msgfmt is installed in $PATH, and show up
		and gnome_app_error if it can't be found by the
		 gnome_is_program_in_path routine from libgnome.
		Don't free a string variable ( "frees" a crash ) and
		 check if we'd used the new dot char feature and if so
		  replace the dot chars again with free spaces. This does
		   solve all FIXME's. Hurray.

	* \*.c: Added 3 FIXME's which are the three places where
		gtranslator crashes regularly; these are FIXME's :)

2000-10-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Added some more conditionals in hope of avoiding more
		crashes, changed the descriptions of the new page's
		 toggle buttons a bit and removed a g_free as I can't
		  see any reason why to free a variable which is again
		   filled 10 lines after the free-ing process.
		Only react if the option is set in the preferences.

	* prefs.c: Added a 4th page with the options to use the dot char
		feature and to enable/disable the pop up menu. Both of them
		 are working in real-time, you can also immediately see the
		  changes in the preferences on the next screen; also moved
		   the save geometry option to the "Miscellaneous" page.

	* parse.c: Add a new GNOME history entry if the file should be parsed,
		so we can later use it in a "Recent files" menu or a favorites
		 or something-alike menu.

2000-10-02  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Put the main.c file at the start of the
		compilation process.

	* main.c: Added an #error define to "avoid" GConf compilations
		for now.

	* gui.c: Changed the pop up menu a bit and integrated some
		 kind of more intelligent menu ( though it's too
		  big and doesn't have got intelligence like the
		   tool bar till now ... ).
		Added a beta-alpha version of the dot char-stuff
		 which does cause more crashs... grrrr...

2000-10-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Only activate the pop up-menu for the two
		text boxes.

	* \*.*: Removed all gtranslator_config_init &
		gtranslator_config_close calls as libgtranslator's
		 functions are doing this now on their own.

2000-09-30  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Added the pop up-menu for gtranslator; it
		reacts only on right click on the text-boxes
		 and should be more expanded later on; also
		  added another menu which some entries.

	* gui.h: Added the prototype for the popup-menu.

	* parse.c: Also free the segments of the GString.

	* main.c: Removed the error message stuff.

	* session.c: Removed some unneeded stuff.

2000-09-29  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: More informations on a GConf error.

2000-09-24  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c, header_stuff.c, session.c & prefs.c:
		Adapted the settings variables to GConf-style.

	* dnd.h: Moved the D'n'D types and enumeration to the
		right places.
	
	* gui.c: The GtkTargetEntries are now settled in here.

	* dnd.h: The enumeration of the D'n'D types is now here.

	* dialogs.c, header_stuff.c & session.c : Include the
		libgtranslator/preferences.h header for the
		 preferences routines of libgtranslator.

	* main.c: Include the GConf header if necessary and
		take the right argument style to the
		 gconf_init function :)

2000-09-23  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Init the GConf library if it's present.

	* find.c: Check if we did get any message before operating
		on it.

2000-09-21  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: Include the "libgtranslator/preferences.h" header.

	* header_stuff.c & dialogs.c: Use only relative paths as this
		would cause a mess in libgtranslator.

	* \*.c: Merged all gnome_config routines to use the libgtranslator
		routines.

	* prefs.c: Use "Do not..." for "Don't..." in the preferences
		settings.

2000-09-20  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Don't let me say that this correction has got also
		something to do with the icons in the search bar ...

2000-09-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* \*.c/h: Reformatted my mail appearance from '[ kabalak@gtranslator.org ]'
		to '<kabalak@gtranslator.org>'.

	* gui.c: Integrated the status information into the status bar and made
		some corrections to these weird search bar stuff; it should
		 now get disabled/enabled the right way.

2000-09-16  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Made some more messages translatable and removed the
		check_file function; we're now using the libgnome-function
		 g_file_exists for that. If there's no such file, it does
		  now use a gnome_app_error to display the error, doesn't
		   parse anything and the app is still there ( hehe,
		    no crash ).
	
		Also disabled the Save button if the file has been saved
		 and haven't been changed since then.

	* parse.h: Removed the check_file prototype as the function
		isn't used/included anymore.

	* gui.c: Corrected another wrong addiction (icon number was wrong),
		added also a fuzzy icon to the search bar and made the Fuzzy
		 icon react with the same intelligence like the Missing
		   icon.

2000-09-15  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: The file is now named TODO.src and not only
		TODO.

	* gui.c: Enable the Goto button if a file has been opened and
		disable the menu entry for "Undo" if no file hasn't
		 been opened; also corrected the wrong menu entry
		  behavior.

2000-09-13  Jesus Bravo Alvarez  <jba@pobox.com>

	* languages.h: Modified Galician team's e-mail address.

2000-09-13  Robert Brady  <rbrady@suse.de>

	* header-stuff.c: (split_name_email) Don't crash if
	str == NULL.

	(get_header) Deal with Project-Id-Version: lines with
	missing version numbers.

	* gui.c: Disable the translation string box if
	no .po is loaded.
	
2000-09-13  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Changed the hotkey for the next fuzzy translation
		to Alt + Z ( slightens the menus a bit ) and changed
		 the icon-caption to "Missing" as this doesn't break
		  the look of the tool bar.

2000-09-12  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gnome-regex.*: reverted to original files from gnome-libs,
		just added 'flags' field to GnomeRegexCache, and check for it
		before comparing patterns. Start search from 0th item
		(was 1st).
	* find.c: for_each_msg -- fail if start item == NULL; iterate on any
		list, not messages. In other functions, added check to pass not
		NULL to this function.
	* dialogs.c: made find dialog option fit in one line.

2000-09-11  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Removed msg_db.* as they'ren't any longer in
		our sources.

	* msg_db.*: Removed these files as we'll give the duty for this
		to gtranslatord.

	* prefs.c/h: Removed all message db parts.

	* gui.c: Removed all message db concerning menus & icons.

	* dialogs.c/h: Removed the query dialog & the query results
		dialogs for now ( including all widgets and variables.)

	* main.c: Removed all msg_db stuff and also cleansed the options
		and message db inits.

2000-09-10  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added the gnome-regex sources to the build sources
		without any conditional tests ( libgnome doesn't have got
		 the gnome_regex_cache_new_with_size ).
	
2000-08-23  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c, parse.c: now absolute file name is got in parse(), wherever
		it was called from. Added some newline, removed some comments,
		to ease the reading of huge parse() and main() functions.
		Ensured file_opened is always in sane state and is checked
		before doing anything with po structure (this avoids
		segfaults).
	* ChangeLog: why lose so much space on this file -- reformatted
		Fatih's	entries to be like mine. So there's half lines, but
		size reduced only by 3k...
	* gui.c: destroy regex cache on quit.
	* parse.c: created actual_parse function, and moved to it the real
		parsing from parse() to make it more clean. Change the title
		of window to contain the filename. In actual_write, check if
		the file has *.pot extension; if so, warn and do nothing.
	* spell.h, spell.c, gui.c: moved spelling code from gui.c to new
		separate files.
	* Makefile.am: added those two files to sources.
	* find.c: in for_each_msg, reverted to jump to po->messages when NULL
		reached, because of problem when passing first == NULL.
	* dialogs.c: added fake option menu to select where to find in.

2000-08-22  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: in update_msg, make both msgid and msgstr end with or without
		'\n'.
	* session.*, main.c: added restore_session(), if client is restored. So
		now goes to the same file and message number.
	* dialog.c: renamed variables in goto_dlg to shorter ones; added policy
		set on spin; changed dialog and label titles.

2000-08-21  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: some cosmetic changes, use variables instead of simple
		../. Added -DGNOMELOCALEDIR. Added check for
		HAVE_MY_REGEX_CACHE, if to compile and link gnome-regex.
	* main.c: use realpath for getting absolute path.
	* session.c: gtranslator now opens the same file on session restore.
		Removed non-interesting comments.
	
2000-08-21  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: yeah, at last this works perfectly. Too much changes
		to list, anyway it's almost complete rewrite. Changed only
		get_header, put_header and edit_header. Use regexps to parse
		fields. A VERY enhanced edit dialog.

2000-08-20  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.*, messages.h, dialogs.c, gui.c, find.c, session.c: at last
		moved all file-specific stuff to GtrPo structure, in that
		inserted new field -- messages list 'length'.
	* header_stuff.*: in GtrHeader, splitted language_team into two fields:
		language and lg_email; also, replaced 'mime_type' with
		'charset'.
	
2000-08-20  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gnome-regex.h, gnome-regex.c: copied these files here from
		gnome-libs/libgnome, because I needed to change the cache
		object so that it stored compilation flags along with pattern
		and regex. Added new type GnomeRegexCacheSlot, for saving all
		info about one regex. Also, changed everything else to reflect
		this change. Function API did not change, just added new
		function: gnome_regex_cache_new_with_size. However, types HAVE
		changed, although they should be used only internally.
	* Makefile.am: added above new files, although should be checked if
		they are needed.
	* parse.h: added check for gnome library version, which I will
		commit my above changes to. Use local file, if not found.
	* msg_db.*: Cleaned up a lot, fixed much errors, got no warnings.
		Though not needed...
	* find.c: in for_each_msg, get first element of given list, not
		messages.

2000-08-17  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* Again big changes. Read below: prefs.h, almost all .c: Instead of
		many if_* variables for preferences, created one structure
		'wants.*', which uses only one bit for toggles.
	* prefs.c: new option: if message was fuzzy, when changed, it could be
		marked non-fuzzy. Changed order of options in dialog. Moved all
		#defines to where they are used, and inserted #undefs
		immediately after. Authors name & e-mail are now GtkEntry's,
		not GnomeEntry's.
	* parse.c, gui.c: made check_msg_status internal, used only for
		parsing. Other functions (update_msg and mark_msg_fuzzy) change
		the status themselves. Rewritten update_msg,
		toggle_msg_status. Now all the job with fuzzy entries does
		mark_msg_fuzzy function. After toggling status, message is
		updated. In text_has_got_changed, added call to unmark fuzzy,
		if wanted.
	* messages.h: moved all typedefs to struct/enum, so we don't need _Type
		hacks. Rewritten GtrPo type, to contain entries we actually
		use.
	* And, while changed much, executable has got only 700 bytes, so it was
		worth work.

2000-08-17  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.*: added mark_msg_fuzzy function, which does actual change to
		message comment. Renamed get_msg_status to update_msg_status
		and changed return type to void. Added rxc -- a regexp cache.
	* gui.*: added a simple 'Undo' menuitem, ACT_UNDO action,
		undo_changes function. When toggled fuzzy status, call
		mark_msg_fuzzy.
	* find.c: use regexps to find. Added update_flags for match case
		updating.
	* main.c: create rxc and change it's size.
	
2000-08-16  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dnd.*, find.*, parse.*: just another rearrangement of #include's.
	* dnd.*: removed gtr_dnd_type -- use guint instead. Removed a_counter
		variable, cleaned up lots of comments.
	* .cvsignore: added tags & .libs

2000-08-15  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.*, header_stuff.c: Lots of changes: moved all language lists to
		prefs.h, introduced lang_ref reference counting variable,
		create_lists() and destroy_lists(). All attach_*_with_label()
		are now in prefs.h, i.e. can be used with any other dialog.
		That was done because edit_header now creates GnomePropertyBox,
		not just dialog, and lets change language properties in header.

2000-08-14  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: simplified main() function, by moving geometry stuff to
		prefs.*. Query now only prints the result, no sick messages.
	* prefs.*: created save_geometry() and restore_geometry(), removed
		gtranslator_geometry_* variables, so that other files do not
		have anything to do with geometry. Geometry is loaded only if
		wanted. Added GTR_CONFIG_PREFIX.
	* gui.c: simplified gtranslator_quit.
	
2000-08-10  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: initial spell checking support. It does not work well,
		but works! I was impressed when I found gnome-spell.h!
	
2000-08-10  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* find.*, gui.*: renamed search_do to find_do. Created new
		for_each_msg function, which works the same as g_list_foreach,
		except that it starts from specified position, and jumps to
		first when end reached. All functions in find.h now uses it.
		Added goto_next_untranslated function, action and callback.
	* gui.c: fixed toggle_msg_status (rewrite). Created new
		function enable_actions_just_opened, which is just a statement,
		for convenience moved from parse.c. ACT_END is now initialized
		to NULL, I think it introduced a crash before.
		update_msg now marks message as untranslated if the
		translation was removed.

2000-08-09  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.[ch]: added update_header function, which
		PO-Revision_Date field.
	* parse.c: called above from actual_write().
	* find.[ch], gui.[ch]: added new menu item -- "Next fuzzy", callback
		for it, ACT_NEXT_FUZZY action (which is disabled when there are
		no more fuzzy messages).

2000-08-08  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.[ch]: added put_header (what a bad name...) function.
		Also, enriched GtrHeader structure with comment field, filled
		it in get_header and freed in free_header.
	* parse.c: because of above change, removed header_li variable. Now the
		header list item is completely destroyed, and created a new
		message when writing the file. Also, give a warning if file has
		no header. In parse(), prepend a message to messages, and then
		reverse - optimization for speed. Removed some comments, where
		the code was self-explanatory. Added a check if any line was
		read, if none -- give an error (and do not crash :)). In
		compile() -- write the po-file to temporary one, and compile
		this -- so you don't need to save before compile.

2000-08-08  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: added update_appbar function and call to it. This shows
		current message in the status bar. Also connected
		clear_selection callback.
	* parse.c: when compiling, show two dialogs, depending on success:
		a message with message counts, or an error message.
	* dialogs.c: added compile_error_dialog function, which shows error
		text, which occurred during compiling.

2000-08-07  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* *.*: reformatted everything with "indent -i8 -kr -l78 -fca -fc1".
		From now I will use Linux kernel coding style
		(/usr/src/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle).
	* gui.[ch]: complete rewrite of "actions" code. Hash table was replaced
		by a static array, and string identifiers -- by integer IDs.
		This prevents typos, and saves a lot of memory and time. Also
		done some reformatting of code and comments (removed some of
		them).
	* find.c: optimized search functions, implemented case insensitive
		search.
	
2000-08-06  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* *.*: got the CVS 2000-08-04 version, today merged them all. I see
		now, that almost none changes made here by Fatih, only by me.
		That's good. gui.c, dialogs.c, prefs.c were totally rewritten
		by me, diff was confused :).
	* main.c: removed free(langs) because we do not own system environment.
		init the msg_db and parse-db only if if_use_msg_db is TRUE.
		Removed pointless pushing - and popping of prefix. Moved query
		handle to front, because then we do not need anything more.
		Also, moved parsing of file after creating the app (if there
		are problems with gui, don't bother with parsing). Because
		filename setting is done in parse(), removed
		gtranslator_set_filename from here.
	* prefs.c: made not use msg db by default, as I could not make program
		not to crash myself.
	* header_stuff.c: fixed that mime_type was not read. Also made new
		header to be filled with zeroes, in case some header field was
		not available.
	* gui.h and so on: moved some #includes to gui.c, this caused
		more #includes to change in another files. Hope now compiles
		faster.
	* find.*: removed crazy stuff (everything :)) and moved search_do
		function to here.
	* gui.c: because goto_given_msg(GList *) already existed, simplified
		all other goto_* to one line with call to it.

2000-08-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* TODO.src: Added some thoughts.
	
	* ChangeLog: Reformatted my entries partly.

2000-08-04  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* about.c: Updated the about-message.

        * ChangeLog: Merged with menesis' ChangeLog.

	* main.c: Added the gettext-init of the poptTable.

	* session.c: disabled the filename storage for now.

2000-08-04  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.*: done the SAME :) with find dialog. That is, made gnome
		dialog with icon/parent/wmclass...
	* prefs.[ch],dialogs.c,header_stuff.c: two new preferences:
		if_match_case (for find dialog) and if_fill_header (for edit
		header dialog). Save them to config.
	* gui.c: written the search_do function and connected it where needed!
		Added a function goto_given_msg, which accepts list item as
		user_data.
	
2000-08-03  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: ended cleanup. Instead of defines, made some functions to
		simplify creating of many similar entries. Will use soon in
		edit_header, maybe...
	* parse.c: fixed the bug with ~ and ! :) now should get correct status.

2000-08-02  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: a major cleanup. Moved all widgets from .h to .c and made
		them static, removed unused ones. Added free_prefs(), which
		cleans memory, allocated with read_prefs; also, prefs_box_close
		callback, which destroys the lists when box closes. Moved the
		code, which initializes the lists, _before_ settting the entries
		with saved values. Added lots of #defines, so that code was more
		readable, because there were lots of very similar lines. Made
		apply callback react only to page_num==-1.
	* main.c,...: moved some variables used only here from various .h.
		There's almost no warnings now...

2000-08-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added the libgtranslator dir to the includes
		and to the LDFLAFS/LDADD variables.

2000-08-01  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: Simplified widget creation and initialization, perhaps just
		removed lots of whitespace... Sorted items in the lists, and
		left only unique ones.

2000-07-31  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: made a new modal ask_to_save_file dialog, It is more
		simple and works perfect! Even in open_file, I used this
		to ask if to save current file before opening new one.
	* gui.[ch]: do not declare gtranslator_quit in gui.h. Changed the
		type of this callback to such as it should be. Applied the
		above change, so modified files are always saved, if the user
		wants to. Added close callback and "action".
	* parse.c: changed the argument of parse(const char*). Made a simplier
		dialog to ask if saving unchanged files. The same to reverting
		a file. Also, used the nice ask_to_save_file, now saving,
		opening, closing and reverting is simple, consistent and safe.

2000-07-30  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: removed -f option from popt table, instead used context for
		getting files to load from command line. Now a file can be
		loaded simply by 'gtranslator lt.po'. Removed duplicating
		testing if file is valid, and a bunch of non-interesting
		comments and braces {}.
	* prefs.c: minor changes -- added some default values, removed
		gnome_config_drop_all() call, because this is done
		automatically.

2000-07-28  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: added ask_to_save function, to be used when closing
		application, and file is unsaved. It works now.
	* gui.*: added disable_actions_no_file, because it is used
		in main.c and when closing file. Added nothing_changes
		variable, it was needed in text_has_got_changed to determine if
		the user or program changes the textbox. Added the callback for
		revert. gtranslator_quit now checks if file was changed. Also,
		closes it (frees the memory). Moved setting of status in front
		of file, because only then it could be seen. Message status in
		menus now reflects to real state of message (display_msg).
	* parse.*: added revert_file and close_file callbacks. Also,
		free_messages function.

2000-07-24  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>
	
	* Everywhere: renamed type names to conform with Glib ones:
		gtr_msg now is GtrMsg, type cast is GTR_MSG(), the same for
		status, header, action, po.
	* header_stuff.c,parse.c: at last header parsing is complete!
		get_header works fine. Edit header dialog also works, though
		there's not much... (maybe shouldn't be).
	* dialogs.c,prefs.c,about.c: added check GNOME_IS_DIALOG(*dlg) to
		show_nice_dialog, so if *dlg is a GnomeDialog, this function
		sets parent of it to be the main app.
	* gui.c: in Message status menu, merged Untranslated and Translated
		into one toggle item :) Still no callbacks.
	* messages.h,parse.c: revised GtrMsgStatus. Now there are only three
		possible stati: translated, fuzzy, and stick, and they are
		flags, so message can be translated AND fuzzy.

2000-07-23  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* Too much changes to list. After all, I see no point in writing this
		file. Anyway, I have changed EVERYTHING here. Almost. Major
		changes and achievements follows:
	* gui.c: major revision. Moved all tool bar creation stuff to
		GnomeUIInfo structure, rearranged all menus and tool bars,
		simplified them, made them standard (stock), removed the
		duplicated find/search entries, changed message status menu to
		toggles/radio items. Created new "actions" framework for
		enabling/disabling of menu/tool bar entries. Works very well.
		Before you load a file you can't do much :) Removed lots of
		stuff from create_app1(), so it looks nice. Of course,
		goto_*_msg got changed *much*, now they change actions only
		if needed.
	* gui.h: respectively, changed this file. Removed all global variables,
		except app1, appbar1, text1, trans_box, and
		gtranslator_geometry. Added actions stuff.
	* header_stuff.[ch]: finally, made the edit_header dialog like others.
	* main.c: minor clean up, related to changes in gui.*. Removed the
		duplicated app1 variable.
	* parse.c: moved compile() function to here. Made Save button actually
		react to settings, so -- ask if to save unchanged files, or do
		not save at all. file_changed should be always in correct
		state now.

2000-07-23  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: Removed no_changes_dialog. Instead added to
	* parse.c: Added save_current_file (a callback for save), actual_write,
		no_reply_callback functions.
	* gui.c: added callbacks for Save.
	
2000-07-22  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.*,../po/POTFILES.in,Makefile.am: renamed from gtr_dialogs.*
	* gui.c: moved get_*_msg, display_msg, update_msg, reached_*_msg,
		do_seach from parse.c to here, because they have nothing to do
		with parsing... renamed get_*_msg to goto_*_msg. removed the
		setting status in compile() when no file is opened. It should be
		disabled anyways. In clean_text_boxes() replaced everything with
		just two gtk_editable_delete_text(...) calls. Replaced
		gtk_text_get_length with -1 :)
		Removed View menu as it has no point.
	* dialogs.[ch]: added convenience functions raise_and_return_if_exists,
		which checks, whether a dialog exist, and if so, shows, raises
		it and returns. The variable should be global or static. At the
		end of dialog another function should be called:
		show_nice_dialog. Why nice? First, it shows the dialog. Next, it
		sets wmclass for it, and finally, an icon.
	* dialogs.c,about.c,prefs.c: according to above improvement, made almost
		all dialogs to use this. So, lots of code was removed and it
		looks nicer. Of course, all dialogs have icons, class, parents;
		may be created only once at a time, after closing they are
		destroyed, and raised if were just obscured.
	* prefs.*: moved widgets from prefs.h to prefs.c as they are not useful
		for anything outside this file. Replaced (gpointer)1 with
			GINT_TO_POINTER.
	* about.[ch]: left only one callback declared here -- about_box. Added
		myself to authors, I think I deserve it ;) Removed the "Now you
		can't see much..." from description, because it works quite
		well. well...
	* parse.c: removed the code which calls usleep. What the hell needs it.
		Instead I changed the status message so that we need only one.
		However, left it in configure.in...
	* *.h: removed lots of unused #include's.
	* TODO: added lots of ideas.

2000-07-21  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gtr_dialogs.[ch]: further gnomefying of dialogs: goto. Related to
		this removal of all g_dlg* global variables and functions,
		leaving only one: goto_dlg, and a callback for it --
		goto_dlg_clicked. Also removed msg_pair_count variable.  GoTo
		dialog now displays current message number when shown.  Made
		*dialog widgets in these three functions static, connected
		signals to make them NULL when destroyed, and first check, if
		the dialog is already created -- then just show it.
	* gui.c: added some ...'s for menu entries, added goto menu entry,
		and callbacks for it, back and next, also changed
		disable/enable_buttons for this.

2000-07-21  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.[ch]: added functions: update_message, save_the_file,
		write_the_message, restore_msg, the latter being quite long.
		They implement writing messages to a file. update_message
		writes the text, if it was changed (a new variable
		message_changed), from trans_box to msgstr. This made
		gtranslator a real and useful application.
	* gtr_dialogs.[ch]: removed the unneeded global variables and lots of
		functions, related to save/open dialogs. There was crap...
		No made to function properly, save as now works. A "save as"
		copy of unchanged file is identically to the original.

2000-07-20  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* Today I consider parsing to be finished. It works!
	* gtr_dialogs.c: replaced a bunch of gtk_widget_show with one
		gtk_widget_show_all, also made the dialog transient
		(g_dlg_create). Still need to do the same for other dialogs.
	* gtr_dialogs.c: corrected the Cancel button to destroy the goto dialog,
		and Go! button to actually work.
	* parse.c: added get_nth_msg for use in goto dialog and convenience
		function reached_middle_msg for enabling buttons. Also:
		added get_msg_status(gtr_msg *) for updating the message status
		with a very simple check. append_line(gchar **, gchar *),
		which formats the message enclosed in "'s and adds it to the
		first string. So messages are displayed nice... Almost.
		Fixed cleaning the boxes when text inside was edited.
		Completely rewrote the parse function, now I do not remember
		what was there before...
	* parse.h: according to parse.c, changed and reformatted the header...
	* gui.c: moved options button just before Exit, wrapped moving buttons
		with separators. Made text1 not editable (really in parse.c).

2000-07-18  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>
	
	* parse.[ch]: totally rewritten the parse() function -- now reads
		messages almost correctly (additional characters, something
		wrong with the line buffer). the header now is got as the first
		message pair, but ignored. Written reached_first_msg and
		reached_last_msg functions for changing the button status.
		Moved the stuff for displaying a message to display_msg
		function. Cleaned up get_****_msg due to above changes.
		Completely removed msg_pair variable, instead added cur_msg --
		a pointer to current message. Added get_msg_status function
		for getting and adjusting the translating status.
	* After all of these changes messages got displayed and
		first/prev/next/last buttons started to work! (What was a goal
		for 0.20, eh?)
	* Have read 64% of this file (till 200-05-24)... Uh...

2000-07-17  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>
	
	* changed all sprintf calls to GLib ones.
	* header_stuff.[ch]: written the get_header and free_header functions
	* parse.c: beginning to change parse() function to work properly
	* messages.h: some comments about places which need change
	* msg_db.c: free the msg_db string (close_msg_db)
	* gui.c: Replaced those crazy gtk_widget_show() with one call at the
		end... Also added a free_header(ph); call in gtranslator_quit

2000-07-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>
	
	* parse.c: Removed the one debug message and the
		corresponding ifdefs.
	
	* main.c: Call the intl-domain of POPT before showing
		the options.
		[ So we're now getting internationalized help
		   messages :) ]

2000-07-12  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* msg_db.c: Return a `0' not `NULL' if the challenge
		length cannot be send.
	
	* Makefile.am: Added these two files to the sources.
	
	* find.c & find.h: Added the files for the find routines.
	
	* main.c: Reformatted the comments and some blocks.
	
	* \*.c: Removed the last rests of these `//' C++
		comments in these C source files.

	* Makefile.am: Added the G_LOG_DOMAIN define for the build
		of gtranslator.

2000-07-06  Fatih Demir	 <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Use the existing static gtr_header and don't
		allocate, assign etc. the values and structures; don't
		 use these long if-trees.

	* gui.c: Bloat this menu with stock pixmaps.

	* gui.c: Extended the menus with a real messages status
		menu tree which represents the possible stati of
		 a message entry.
	
	* gui.c: Adding another menu-subtree from where you can
		define the msg_status field of every message.
		[ Only foo'ish for now .... ]
	
	* gtr_dialogs.c: Get the challenge-length from the Spinbutton
		for querying the messages db.
	
	* main.c: Corrected a typo at the `--challenge-length'
		option.

2000-07-04  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Disable the corresponding menu entries
		also if no file is open.
	
	* main.c: Added another option to specify the
		desired minimum match length ( aka.
 	 	 challenge length); perform a little
		  check before applying the default
		   challenge length;
		    set the default challenge length to 2.
	
	* msg_db.c: Two new routines which are setting the
		challenge length ( the length of the
		 strncasecmp-calls while retrieving the
 		  results for the query. ).
	
	* msg_db.h: Added the variable and the two prototypes for
		the new functions and the new variable.

2000-06-30  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* msg_db.c: Added the size returning function for
		the messages db handling.
	
	* header_stuff.c: Removed the free/malloc stuff from the
		header routines.

2000-06-14  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* .cvsignore: Removed dummy.po from the repo and from
		the .cvsignore.
	
	* header_stuff.c: Do the same again like weeks before,
		fill up the structure.

2000-06-12  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Removed the ifdef for the header routines.
		started to work on `real'( TM ;) ) header routines.
		 get the message only then to the list if it's a
		  msg-block.
		   [ I love this font-shadowing from Eterm,
		     my CPU doesn't but that's another point.]
	
	* parse.c: Hmm, do some more widget work.

2000-06-11  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Take the string length of the temp_char
		as array length; ise two gchar's for the
		 operations (removed the "zamane" gchar.).

2000-06-10  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>
 
	* parse.c: Use a generally fresh allocated gchar for
		the parsing routines; corrected a typo.

        * main.c: Make the output of '-q' on the cmd-line
		look a bit better.

	* EURO 2000 >)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)

	* Set the gtr_msg_status field according to
	
		the msgid; that's not the most perfect way
	
		to do it, but it seemed possible to me.

	* Use some voodoo to do the strip-off.

	* Rip the msgid and the msgstr clearly from
	
		the gchar.
	
		-> parse.c

	* Don't free the gchar as it's still used.
	
	* Made the mentioned gchar not allocated.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c

2000-06-09  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Highlight the main window during a drop.
	
		-> gui.c

	* Set the window properties and again use
	
		the window-icon if possible.
	
	* Adding the query dialog, the widgets
	
		and the according routines.

		-> *.c
	
	* Changed the includes from all the files.
	
		-> *.h

	* Changed interface.c/h to gui.c/h.
	
	* Removed support.* really. They'ren't
	
		used by neither gtranslator nor from

		-> support.*

	* Connect the signals, buttons and menu

	* Use g_strconcat rather than strcat.

	* Implemented the ( hopefully ) good

	* Removed the final gboolean; it has been
	
		replaced by three other gboolean which
	
		are also useful for the recognition of
	
		multi-line translations.

	* Disable the corresponding button if we're
	
		at the first/last entry.

	* Implementing the button-callbacks as
	
		functions.

		case.
	
	* Removed the ifdef, so we can now again
	
		watch gtranslator crashing...
	
		-> parse.c
	
	* Reverted to the old mechanism.
	
		-> header_stuff.c

	* Adjust the dialog size.

	* Create a table holding the widgets for the
	
		Find-dialog.
	
	* You can only "goto" till the last entry of

		bit.
	
	* Quit after the query before any GUI-element is loaded.
	
	* Print the query & the result.

	* Added a for-the-moment dummy option '-q' / '--query'
	
		which will be used to query the msg_db for entries
	
		without starting the whole GUI. Possibly ...
	
		-> main.c

2000-06-03  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Make first a check if it exists yet, and
	
		it it doesn't exist, print a message and open
	
		it with creation flags.

	* Create the msg_db, if necessary.
	
		-> msg_db.c

	* Set the window-icon in every popup-dialog.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c

		variable for the msg_db location.

	* Removed the "hard-coded" msg_db stuff.
	
		-> msg_db.c/h

	* Removed the MSG_DB definition as it's
	
		now made more practically with an option
	
		or in the user's dir.
	
		-> Makefile.am

	* Print out a string-based error message
	
		and not only the error number which isn't
	
		quite useful.
	
		-> parse.c

	* Set the widget sizes to be more nice, as we
	
		surely want to be able to read the mini-window
	
		titles without resizing.

	* Added a basic search dialog which is really
	
		poor in this state.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c/h

	* Show a little message before doing the quit.

	* Connected the additional signals for the
	
		find dialog.

	* Added another button to the search-bar; an
	
		`Add'-button which adds the current message
	
		pair to the msg_db.

	* Connect the corresponding function with the
	
		button.

	* Free the freshly allocated gchar's.

	* Added another function which is a callback
	
		function in between adding the entries to
	
		the msg_db and the corresponding button.
	
	* Close the msg_db on quit, if the msg_db has
	
		been inited/opened.
	
		-> interface.c

	* Check for the msg_db option and do some checks.

        +       Init the crappy-but-self-written

                -> main.c

2000-05-28  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

                and into the vbox.

        +       Added a check-button which lets you use
 
                your personal options defined in the Preferences
 
                section to fill out the header.

	* Moved some variable declarations around.

	* Set the geometry  from the prefs &
	
		the stored place.

	* Made the Gtk+ entry-boxes to GNOME
	
		entry-boxes and added a table holding
	
		all the nice entry-boxes and the labels.

	* Adding the first entry-boxes which
	
		are holding the parsed informations.
	
		-> header_stuff.c
	
	* Removed another crash reason; the check
	
		for the filename is now only done by an
	
		assertion (!=NULL), nothing more.

	* Make the Goto button also sensitive;
	
		disable it if no po-file is opened.
	
		-> interface.c

2000-05-25  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

		be useless.
	
	* Introduced another static gchar -- the
	
		filename.
	
	* Making the parse-routine again produce
	
		dozens of structure's.
	
		-> parse.c
	
2000-05-21  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

		header and filled the informations into
	
		the header_structure.

	* Create a structure which holds all
	
		these informations.
	
	* Added some debug-g_print's.

		available with a search-pixmap.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c

	* Print a warning if the geometry-string

		with my brain!

	* Removed some unneeded GList's and changed
	
		the head GList to a GSList.
	
		-> parse.h

	* Creation and filling into the structure
