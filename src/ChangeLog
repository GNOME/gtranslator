	* message.c (gtranslator_message_status_set_fuzzy): Don't free
	comment. Fixes several crashes and file corruption bugs (#130114,

2004-01-12  Dan Damian  <dand@gnome.ro>

2004-01-01  Roozbeh Pournader  <roozbeh@sharif.edu>

	* languages.c: Corrected information for Persian.

2003-12-23  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

2003-10-03  Ross Golder <ross@golder.org>

	* parse.c: Pluralised a couple of strings.
	* gui.c: Pluralised a couple of strings.

2003-09-02  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* about.c: Added Abel to the documentation authors' list.

2003-09-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* about.c: Small cosmetic stuff about the authors' list - added a
		small separator "sign" between the current and the previously
		 involved authors.

2003-08-29  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Chech while parsing if the charset in the header is still
		on the default value CHARSET and if so, then let's simply
		 assume that the charset of such files is UTF-8 now as it's
		  good to do so/default and such; solves b.g.o #121028.

2003-08-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* utf8.[ch]: Removed unused ("[depr") gtranslator_utf8_convert_to_utf8
		function.

	* main.c: Also "#include <libintl.h>" for the bindtextdomain call so
		that maybe the FreeBSD compile tries are much successfuller
		 now :-)

	* Makefile.am: De-sophisticate the rules a bit to make it eventually
		work on more systems.

	* learn.[ch] & main.c: Implemented a command line statistics output
		screen via "-s/--learn-statistics" on main program call.

	* dialogs.c, prefs.[ch] & prefs_init.c: Introduce 6 new variables for
		remembering the search and replace categories which're marked
		 in the corresponding dialogs between the actions and sessions
		  by saving them in the prefs.

	* defines.config & main.c: Solve that sometimes occuring problem with
		the GNOMELOCALEDIR define in defines.config/h by setting the
		 GNOMELOCALEDIR usage in main.c to use DATADIR "/locale" which
		  should be the same :-)

2003-08-27  Ross Golder <ross@golder.org>

	* utils_gui.c (gtranslator_utils_invert_dots): Do not use middot for
	        line breaks - looks ugly.
	
	* parse.c (append_line): Allocate twice the size of the input line
	       to allow for conversion to multibyte charsets (can segfault
	        otherwise)

	* main.c: Add #include <locale.h> as per manpage setlocale(3).

2003-08-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: Also handle the case where the strings to replace (with)
		are missing with an app error dialog - the english messages
		 there should really be changed IMHO but my English is quite
		  horrible as you can read in the sources sometimes ;-)
	
	* find.[ch]: Typed in some code changes and made it alike the replace
		stuff, getting it away wiht FEFuncRX and such crap but it's
		 likely to be ported now and to solve the UI bug #120227.

	* dialogs.c & replace.[ch]: Ongoing changes for the find and the
		replace dialog - the replace dialog is already redone and the
		 find dialog is on the way to be solving the b.g.o #120227.

	* gui.c: Adept the application bar message to also indicate whether
		we've got currently a plural forms message present (think of
		 the case when you turned the "plural forms dialog" option off
		  in your prefs).

	* dialogs.c, prefs.[ch] & prefs_init.c: Added a hotkey selection to
		the prefs dialog where you can simply select from the GNOME/
		 KDE hotkey chars '_' and '&' ATM and the full implementation
		  of this stuff is also already done there and accepted in the
		   find dialog; solves b.g.o #59206 after a long time :-)

	* gui.c: Removed our own keypress handler to get the Ctrl+Left/Right
		and such things going - it works by itself now in the Gtk+ 2.x
		 days and therefore it has to go now; w/ the keypress handler
		  the b.g.o #120224 goes too :-)

2003-08-26  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Small bits of string change for the option descriptions.

	* dialogs.c: Also close the auto translation and query dialogs when
		there's any response - the gtk_widget_destroy callbacks where
		 missing sometimes; this solves b.g.o #120570. Make the auto
		  translation dialog a question dialog and !a warning dialog.

	* messaegs-table.c: Set/unset the "table_already_created" var when
		creating/clearing the messages table - doesn't interact with
		 the bug #120596 but should make the var handling better.

	* messages-table.c & parse.[ch]: Added the "table_already_created"
		gboolean value to the GtrPo structure which gets set to "TRUE"
		 if the messages table has been built up - fixes b.g.o #120596
		  which caused a crash due to a non-created messages table
		   though being the translation changed and updated (replacing
		    the PACKAGE and VERSION keywords).

2003-08-25  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* message.c: Also update the translation facts if we're copying a
		msgid to the msgstr - it's now bound to the "Fuzzy" group in
		 the messages table as it's set to the virtual status "Sticky"
		  and fixes b.g.o #120575.

	* utils.c: Applied Abel Cheung's patch for the string voodoo
		comparison routines - fixes b.g.o #120567.

2003-08-22  Yukihiro Nakai  <nakai@gnome.gr.jp>

	* main.c: (addresses b.g.o #120454)
	  setlocale() before gnome_program_init() to localize --help message.
		  move bind_textdomain_codeset() after gnome_program_init().

2003-08-17  Ross Golder <ross@golder.org>

	* parse.c: If header specifies a particular charset, attempt to
	        convert to/from that charset when loading/saving.
	
	* parse.c (append_line/restore_msg): Only deal with double quotes, as
	        dealing with backslashes breaks load/save.

2003-08-16  Ross Golder <ross@golder.org>

	* parse.c (append_line/restore_msg): (Un)escape backslashes and double
	        quotes when reading/writing the po file.

2003-08-10  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c, prefs.[ch] & prefs_init.c: Comeplemented base work for a
		selection of hotkey chars but didn't implement the prefs widget
		for that - must now go washing, eating and such ;-)

	* utils.[ch]: Removed the old colorscheme data conversion functionality
		for the pre-2001-03-something color data, we don't need it.

	* dialogs.c & prefs.[ch]: Added a "Ignore hotkeys" toggle button to
		the find dialog for adressing the very old b.g.o #59206.

	* message.c, prefs.[ch] & prefs_init.c: Added an option to define
		whether to show automatically the plural forms viewing/editing
		 dialog and to respect it (should solve now b.g.o #117147).

	* parse.c: Change order of parsing - first build up the messages
		table and then show the 1st message; this avoids a crash
		 with the plural forms editing dialog when being called
		  on the 1st message without any table being actively
		   present in the GUI.

	* messages-table.c: The own messages table coloring of the different
		states of the messages is working now again - had to add a
		 new invisible column "foreground-gdk" and to handle all the
		  stuff from there with our GtrMessagesTableColors structure.

	* parse.c: Fix the writing of plural forms, we were also writing the
		"msgstr[2]" item out as a "msgstr[1]" item -- fixed now.

	* message.c: Did the editing job for the plural forms dialog, it's now
		capable of saving, displaying the changed strings for the
		 plural forms and works, yeah!

	* dialogs.c, gui.c, message.c & messages-table.[ch]: Removed the now
		unnecessary "_update_message_status" function skeleton from
		 the sources as the "_update_row" function does also change
		  message status now since Ross' change - so we do also use
		   this function; the "_select_row" function does also work
		    now but if the tree is closed you don't see the selected
		     row at all and such. This is left over...

2003-08-09  Ross Golder <ross@golder.org>

	* messages.h: Added 'iter' GtkTreeIter to indicate messages table
	      row.
	* messages-table.c: Implemented 'gtranslator_messages_table_update_row'
	      and made root nodes globally accessible.

2003-08-03  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* message.c: Make the plural forms translations editable via the
		cell renderer - we do now need to catch changes and parse
		 them in via a callback.

	* gui.c, message.c, messages-table.[ch] & prefs_init.c: Removed some
		old unused E/GAL stuff from the table and re-checked in the
		 old colros reading code, I'll look afetr the coloring of the
		  messages later on - now the dialog shows up the plural forms
		   of a message in a separate window. This will be of course
		    enhanced but gives a first shot at it.

	* messages-table.c, prefs.[ch] & prefs_init.c: Re-activated & renamed
		the collapse translated entries pref for the messages table
		 to be "Collapse all entries" and to respect this on the new
		  GtkTreeView which we're using to display the messages.

	* main.c: Removed the the webalizing option & the nosyntax option from
		the command line options - we haven't got any webalizing code
		 left over anymore and the nosyntax option should be only
		  possible from the prefs dialog, an usage from the cmdline
		   doesn't seem very logical and suppliable for me.

	* dialogs.c: Fixed the "Save as" dialog callbacks as the signal was
		connected to the wrong "response" - a change to "clicked" for
		 the button clicks in the file selection dialog and now the
		  save as dialog works :-)

	* header_stuff.c: Handle the report msgid bugs to header part more
		seriously and don't print "(null)" to the po files.

	* message.c, messages.h & parse.c: Implement a studido way of support
		for the plural forms via simply attaching msgstr_1/_2 to the
		 GtrMsg structure - is stupid, but shall work and makes it
		  also possible to reuse our beloved and already functions
		   for the string handling; the normal parsed "msgstr[0]"
		    field is representen by "msgstr" in GtrMsg to make the
		     editing more obvious and logical.

2003-08-02  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* message.c, messages.h & parse.c: More integration of plural forms
		parsing into the simple "msgstrs" string array in the GtrMsg
		 structure now - a list seems for me a bit overloaded for
		  this issue of multiple strings, a striny array shall be
		   better I guess.

	* header_stuff.[ch] & parse.c: More preparations for a plural forms
		handling - but nothing really working yet.

	* .cvsignore, Makefile.am: Change the build rule (and CVS ignore) for
		our definitions include file - it's now named "defines.h" and
		 not "defines.include" anymore after the substitution.

	* color-schemes.c, main.c, menus.c, messages-table.c, prefs.c, \
		prefs_init.c & update.c: Adept for the change to "defines.h".

2003-07-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* messages.h, message.c & parse.c: First preparements for the try to
		get plural forms in gettext po files working - just some stuff
		 in there, nothing really working yet :-)

2003-07-22  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: An approach for solving 115973 on b.g.o by making the
		buttons on the recovery dialog more reasonable; implemented
		 the Cancel option in the recovery dialog like Reinout pointed
		  out as "Postbone decision" to make more sense :-)

2003-07-21  Ross Golder <ross@golder.org>

	* gui.c (insert_text_handler): Re-instated 'insert-text' handler
	        for trans_box to convert spaces to dots when applicable.
		Fixes #115457.

	* dialogs.c (gtranslator_edit_comment_dialog): Saved a function
	        call by using 'gtk_text_buffer_get_bounds'.

2003-07-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* bookmark.[ch]: Added some convenience functionalities and easyness
		functions - just out of lazyness and because of the dialog
		 stuff...

	* actions.[ch], dialogs.[ch] & menus.c: Added a GUI menu entry below
		"File" to add a bookmark - adding a dialog with which you can
		  simply add a bookmark with a comment or not and such.

	* bookmark.[ch], gui.c, main.c & menus.[ch]: Added the GUI version of
		the bookmarks' list under "_View" and it's displayed now
		 rightly like the history list with the recent files :-) But
		  is just a hack of the history code to be adepted to the
		   bookmarks' mechanism and no new innovation unfortunately,
		    could be done better; removed the cmdline messages and
		     such now from the code as the GUI works now.

	* messages.h: Added 2 gint entries to the "GtrMsg" structure and a new
		status enum value - the 2 gints represent the ideas of how to
		 handle the multiple msgstr translations within newer gettext
		  implementations; the "group" gint should be set to 0 for
		   usual msgid/msgstr pairs but for multiple msgstr pairs it
		    shall be a unique, counting number for grouping the msgstr
		     to the msgid - the "level" gint counts the levels of the
		      msgstr entries, e.g. to 1 -> first , 2 -> second, 3 ->
		      	third msgstr translation etc. to get also 2+ msgstr
			 translations into the GtrMsg structure.

	* header_stuff.c: Make the "report msgid bugs to" address entry active
		so that you can copy/cut the address from there to write mail
		 to the reporting adress - there is specifically NO callback
		  bound to that entry as it shall not be changed at all by
		   the translator and therefore can just be handled by the
		    translator to send mails etc.

	* languages.h & translator.h: Comments shall be pure C and not C++
		style comments like "//", at least in the headers...

	* bookmark.[ch], gui.[ch] & main.c: Added bookmarks' mechanism to get
		it working, loading, saving entries works, GUI integration
		 is not done yet, but Ctrl+Home gets a new bookmark entry in
		  your preferences to get added. Two fat FIXMEs are waiting
		   in the bookmark.c file for resolvation of free'ing actions.

	* dialogs.c & prefs.c: Fixed b.g.o #117315 and removed trailing spaces
		from 2 messages.

2003-07-07  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Replaced 'get_start_iter/get_end_iter' with
	           'get_bounds'.
	
	* dialogs.c (gtranslator_should_the_file_be_saved_dialog): Added
	           'Don't save' button.

	* prefs.c: Completely revised tab layout and packing (much nicer).
	           Thanks to SÃÅŸren Wedel Nielsen <swn@herlevkollegiet.dk>.
	
	* prefs.c: Converted from GnomePropertyBox to a GnomeDialog
	           with a GtkNotebook (GTK2-compliant).

	        to 'g_ascii_strcasecmp' (undeprecated).

	* stylistics.c (gtranslator_set_style): Changed gdk_font_unref and 
	        gtk_style_unref to g_object_unref.

	* parse.c (gtranslator_save_file): Switch from GnomeWarningDialog
	        to GtkMessageDialog.

2003-07-06  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* nautilus-string.c (nautilus_strcasecmp): Replaced g_strcasecmp
	        with undeprecated g_ascii_strcasecmp.

2003-07-06  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am, htmlizer.c/.h & main.c: Removed the HTMLizing functions
		from the sources and CVS like announced on the mailing list.

2003-07-05  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Converted from GnomePropertyBox to a GnomeDialog
	           with a GtkNotebook (GTK2-compliant).
	
	* vfs-handle.c: Updated a load of deprecated stuff.

	* update.c: Updated a load of deprecated stuff.

	* menus.c: Updated a load of deprecated stuff.
	
	* htmlizer.c: Updated a couple of deprecated calls.
	
	* history.c: Updated a couple of deprecated calls.
	
	* utils_gui.c (gtranslator_utils_attach_text_with_label): The text
	          buffer has the 'changed' signal, not the textview.

	* parse.c (gtranslator_po_free): Add 'g_return_if_fail(po!=NULL)'.

	* gui.[ch] (gtranslator_quit): Was defined gint, but returning
	          gbooleans. I just made it void.

	* Makefile.am: Use DEPRECATED_FLAGS. Lets exorcise those evil
	          GTK1 spirits!

2003-07-05  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* gui.c/message.c/parse.c: Don't include gtkspell.h
	
	* dialogs.c (gtranslator_edit_comment_dialog): Removed
	         unnecessary 'Apply' button (#115291).

	* Makefile.am (gtranslator_SOURCES): Removed gtkspell.[ch] until
	         it can be ported to latest GtkSpell and reintegrated.
		 Removed redundant sources from CVS too.

	* color-schemes.c (GetData): Replaced deprecated 'g_strcasecmp'
	         with plain 'strcmp' (no need for case insensitivity).

	* header_stuff.c: Replaced deprecated 'g_strcasecmp' with plain
	         'strcmp' (no need for case insensitivity).

	* dialogs.c/h: Replaced all deprecated GTK/GNOME calls with
	         updated versions. In particular, change all GtkText
		 objects to GtkTextView objects, and replace all
		 GnomeDialog objects with GtkDialog objects.

	* main.c/parse.c: Move global open_anyway from main to parse.

	* undo.c/h: Use GtkTextIters instead of character positions.

	* utils_gui.c/dialogs.c: Made 'gtranslator_already_open_dialog'
	         and moved code from utils_gui to dialogs.
	
2003-07-01  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* parse.c (gtranslator_file_revert): Replaced deprecated
	         GNOME_STOCK_BUTTONs with GTK_STOCK buttons.

	* dialogs.c (gtranslator_edit_comment_dialog): Fixed problem
	         where contents of comments textview not retrieved

	        (should be none left)

	* gui.c, messages.c, messages-table.c, parse.c, syntax.c,
	        syntax-elements.h: Removed compiler warnings.
	
	* utils_gui.c (gtranslator_utils_restore_geometry): Prevent
	        some 'may be used uninitialised' type warnings.

2003-06-17  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Corrected the header output problem pointed out
		by Alessio Dessi <alessio.dessi@libero.it> on the super
		 gtranslator-devel list - all parts are now exported in
		  the right places (it was just a shift in the order of
		   the entries) and corrected the message string bugs
		    send-to entry's handling a bit.

2003-06-16  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* *.* : Added #ifdef UTF8_CODE around code that could be removed
	         when suitable non-UTF8 import/export routines are ready.

	* utf8.[ch]: Take po as an argument, instead of assuming we're
	         going to be working on the global po. These two files
	         will soon be redundant anyway.
	
	* parse.c: Pass po around as a pointer, instead of relying on
	         it being a global. Will make it easier to parse other
		 files for, say merging, or having multiple files open.
	
	* parse.[ch]: Broke the GUI related stuff in parse_main into
	         parse_main_extra, so it is only called when needed.

	* main.c (main): Stole some code from gedit to make passing
	         filenames on the command line work again.
	
	* header_stuff.c: Fixed parsing of header (#115248)

	* utils_gui.c: Include 'parse.h' instead of duplicating function
	        prototype.


2003-06-15  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Extended authors' lines in the copyright notice :-)
		Besides this, added a GTR_HEADER() assignment to get
		 'round in the problematic case of a non-working header
		   parsement here.

	* header_stuff.c/.h: Also parse the "Report-Msgid-Bugs-To" item
		in the po file headers into the GtrHeader structure.

	* languages.c: Added Icelandic entry as suggested by SamÃºel JÃ³n
		Gunnarsson <sammi@techattack.nu>.

2003-06-10  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Activated the "-n" option fake'ly by writing down
		in the description that it doesn't work - but we'll at
		 least have got the option present; currently we don't
		  highlight any syntax at all...

	* translator.c: Made the default charset of the new default
		translators for'd GtrTranslator structure to be "UTF-8".

2003-06-08  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* gui.c, menus.[ch], prefs.[ch], prefs_init.c: Removed the
	'main_popup_menu', as it blocks access to the default GTK2
	textview popup menu (with IM options etc). (#114470)

	* find.c (find_in_msg): Removed a check that was making the search
	ignore untranslated messages. (#81218)

2003-06-07  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* parse.c, learn.c, header_stuff.c: Removed code that attempted
	to escape/unescape and reformat messages when loading and saving
	po files. (#102542)

2003-06-01  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* parse.c (restore_msg): Only break line if not in the middle of
	   a multibyte character.
	* parse.c (gtranslator_parse_core): Add warning if parser finds
	   a line containing invalif utf-8. Useful for debugging.

2003-05-25  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* about.c: Updated the about dialog to include Ross in the authors'
		list and removed Kevin (as he probably wanted it from me
		 long time ago ;-)) from it.

2003-05-25  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* about.c (gtranslator_about_dialog): Fix copyright notice, for
	legal reasons. (#102453)

2003-05-25  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* actions.c (gtranslator_actions_set_up_file_opened): Enable and
	disable editability of trans box when file open/closed. Prevents
	an easy segfault.

	* parse.c (gtranslator_parse): If first message in file is not a
	header, default po->header to avoid segfaults (bug #62244).

2003-05-25  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* messages-table.c: +302, Added a missing brace :-)

2003-05-24  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* messages-table.c: Fix problem causing corruption of po->current
	and subsequent segfault on next/prev message (#91664).

	* gui.c (gtranslator_text_boxes_clean): Minor optimisation using
	gtk_text_buffer_get_bounds().

	* header_stuff.c: Fix handling of po header comment field.

	* utils_gui.c (gtranslator_utils_invert_dot): Would only run if
	string was less than 0 characters in length (never?!)
	* utils_gui.c (gtranslator_utils_attach_text_with_label): Create
	and use a GtkTextBuffer with the GtkTextView widget.

	* gui.c (gtranslator_keyhandler): Fixed shifted keypresses being
	blocked
	* gui.c: Re-instated 'changed' callback.
	
2003-04-27  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* gui.c (gtranslator_keyhandler): return FALSE if we haven't
	    handled things.

2003-02-25  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* languages.c: Applied patch for the languages' list file by
		Guntupalli Karunakar <karunakar@freedomink.org>.

2003-01-29  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* languages.c: Applied Bengali addition patch by Sayamindu Dasgupta
		<unmadindu@Softhome.net>.

2003-01-12  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am & main.c: Changed the build information screen a little
		bit and put also the information about the Libxml 2.0 into the
		 output screen and the default learn buffer location is now
		  also shown on the screen following the "-b" switch call of
		   gtranslator.

	* utf8.[ch]: Added new "gtranslator_utf8_convert_to_utf8" util function
		which does simply save you some bits of typing, nothing really
		 interesting...

	* main.c: Re-enable the now should-be-working functions and parts.

	* utils.h: Remove non-defined function declarations - there were
		mostly "gtranslator_utf8_get_plain*" functions which are now
		 not existing anymore and not necessary due to Gtk+ 2.x. 

	* learn.c: Smaller modifications to the learn buffer stuff to work now
		really per UTF-8 and to get the point 'bout the premiereversion
		 now right - this was causing the probs with the learn buffer
		  until now - the learn buffer filename has again be changed
 		   to "personal-learn-buffer.xml".

	* semerkent/semer-file.[ch]: Added a new "semer_file_save_as_with_type"
		function which encapsulates some lines of work, yeah! Slight
		 typical changes also included (return values are existing
		  now).

	* semerkent/*.[ch]: Copyright notice a little bit changed, the web-
		address which was written down in the header was removed and
		 the copyright years updated.

2003-01-11  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* runtime-config.[ch] & utils.c: Removed any rests of the lungering
		"etstates" directories/files: we don't need them anymore as we
		  don't use any GAL now and don't have got any etstates
                   therefore.

2003-01-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* \*.[ch]: Updated the years of copyright for some files now awesome
		and made the authors' list accurent where necessary.

	* dnd.c: Fix the old and outcommented DnD code with new, easier and
		possibly foolish code, but it should now work and the code
		 does even also read quite sane now, heyya!

	* messages-table.c: Slicked down the messages' table the the useful
		and non-doubled party (Status, Message & Translation), all
		 other columns are now removed as they're already present in
		  the current GUI in the one or another kind. Should also
		   make the table faster for navigation.

	* color-schemes.c: Adept the signal connecting functions to the
		new g_signal_* stuff (just renaming and a bit of casting).

	* gui.c & utils_gui.c: Some more fixing of the old codes 'round
		there - now the geometry parsing and setting etc. was fixed
		 and the XXX comments in the GUI creation were removed:
		  they're currently not needed :-)

2002-12-31  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Removed the out-commented but also unneeded calls for the
		setting of orientation and style of the toolbars: the
		 orientation is now per default horizontal in Gtk+ and the
		  style should also be adaptent to the desktop, therefore
		   no own setting is set anymore now.

	* learn.c: Rename the default learn buffer file for now to a stupid
		"Standard_Learn_Buffer.xml" - beware us from taken over
		  gtranslator 0.4x learn buffers...

	* actions.c, color-schemes.c, gui.c, menus.c/.h & message.c: Adept to 
		the HIG guideline and move some menu points through the menus.

2002-12-30  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Removed the Semerkent testing bits, it's working, we've all
		seen this now and are happy, yeaaahha! The currently non-
		 working options have also been commented our now (with
		  "FIXME"s marked, if the functionalities are coming back one
		    can enable it quite easily).

	* languages.c: Added language information for "Kannada" as supplied
		from Pramod R <pramodleo@yahoo.co.uk>.

2002-12-29  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Temporarily use some of the Semerkent functions to test the
		possibilities for an integrated version of Semerkent in the
		 gtranslator world.

	* Makefile.am: Added "semerkent" subdirectory to the subdirs - it will
		be now also linked to gtranslator (currently needlessly...). 

	* semerkent/: Simply added a stripdown version of the semerkent
		sources to here, will locally adopt it and get it useful for
		 gtranslator itself: it will be now just a noninst library.

2002-12-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c, message.c & utils_gui.c: Oh man, there are so
		stupid things in coding life...

	* learn.c, utils.c/.h & vfs-handle.c: The awkward adaptations
		necessary to get all the renamings etc. running (the
		 previously e_xml_* stuff is now gtranslator_xml_*).

	* Makefile.am, e-xml-utils.c/.h & utils.c/.h: Moved over the only
		used 4 funcitons of these GAL source files into our own
		 source files - makes it saner and less complex to compile;
		  the GAL source files aren't necessary anymore and were
		   therefore removed.

2002-12-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* message.c & utils_gui.c: Some smaller assertion fixes to get
		some crashes fixed - glittering points of maligned code
		 was sighted too...

2002-09-29  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added "-Werror" back to the default compile flags.

	* header_stuff.c, history.c, prefs.c & utils.c/.h: Added some missing
		casts and/or adjusted some functions parameter-wise.

2002-09-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* defines.config & main.c: Updates in the build information "screen"..

	* Makefile.am: Tsts, the script/program is called pkg-config, NOT
		pkgconfig...

2002-09-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c, message.c, syntax.c, utf8.c & utils._gui.c/.h: Applied invert
		dot patch by Benjamin Dauvergne <feanor@tol-eressea.org>.

2002-09-21  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* color-schemes.c & dialogs.c: Removed debugging g_message calls.

	* Makefile.am: Adapt to the new GNOME 2 build specs.

2002-08-12  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* Makefile.am: don't build convert.*. fix localedir for Solaris.
	* convert.c, convert.h: remove.
	* runtime-config.c, utf8.c, utils.c: use glib functions for charset
	conversion. Removed not used functions.
	* main.c: get translations in UTF-8.
	* about.c: show translators and documenters using new features of
	gnome2 about dialog. Put logo in about box. Remove showing of
	color scheme author.
	* actions.c, actions.h, menus.h, message.c: remove 
	Message Status/Translated menu item. It never made any sense.
	* comment.c: disable conversion of comments to utf8, as it crashes. I
	doubt it is needed anyway.
	* defines.config, main.c: remove BACKENDS_DIR
	* dialogs.h: remove gtranslator_raise_dialog...
	* dialogs.c, header_stuff.c: ...use gtk_window_present instead
	* prefs.c: allow only one dialog to be open.
	* some more files: remove bogus casts and checks, don't use deprecated
	gnome-util functions.

2002-08-04  Christophe Fergeau <teuf@users.sourceforge.net>

	* convert.c
 	* convert.h
 	* gui.c
 	* header_stuff.c
 	* parse.c
 	* utf8.c
 	* utf8.h: UTF8 and GUI cleanups (removed some UTF8 functions which
 	are no longer useful since glib/gtk works internally in UTF8)

2002-08-04  Christophe Fergeau <teuf@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dialogs.c
	* gui.c
	* gui.h
	* header_stuff.c
	* main.c
	* message.c
	* messages-table.c
	* parse.c
	* prefs.c
	* syntax.c
	* syntax.h
	* utils_gui.c
	* utils_gui.h: more GNOME2 work. gtranslator can now load some po files
	and allows you to browse through the strings without crashing. 
	Things to know if you want to work on this port : the various signal
	callbacks used when some text was inserted/deleted are currently 
	commented out, and the whole highlighting stuff needs to be rewritten
	to use GtkTextTag.
	The loading of the po file also needs to be reworked, at the moment
	I only go through all the messages after the file is loaded to convert
	them to UTF8. Maybe that can be improved.

2002-07-30  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* e-xml-utils.c: Added a stupid assignment to avoid a compilation error.

2002-07-26  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am, \*.c/.h: Removed all references to the backend functions
		and/or code calls.

	* backend.c/.h & backends/: Removed the useless backends code snippets.

2002-07-20  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Removed GAL_LIBS LDADD as it's now already unneeded
		anymore.

2002-04-20  Thomas Ziehmer <thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* *.c *.h: Moving to gnome-2

2002-04-05  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Take over the stable compile change.

2002-03-30  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: A small typo fix (like in stable).

2002-03-22  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

        * header_stuff.c: Fix UTF-8 handling for the header fields -- we do
		now also show correct header comment and translator names in
		 the right locale form -- no more crappled text entries.

	* comment.c: Fix the extreme spewage about failed assertions for some
		parts of the GtrComment structure -- we are now a bit smarter
		 on comment parts creation.

2002-03-18  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* formats.c, runtime-config.c/.h: Hide the formats checking routines
		from the command line spamming front -- we do now use another
		 small temporarily created file for this, should en-quiet'en
		  the formats checking functionality a bit.

2002-03-17  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* utils.c: Take over fix in the stable branch for the UTF-8 related
		bug b.g.o #69720.

	* learn.c: Also fix the po file exporting error like done in the stable
		branch.

	* runtime-config.c: Take over patch from stable branch: don't use an
		empty string for middle dot receiption routines, it's already
		 reserved by gettext for the po file headers.

2002-03-15 Peeter Vois <peeter@gtranslator.org>

	* message.c: the sudden pointer jump in translation text removed 
		I hope.

2002-03-14  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* syntax.c: Committed a patch'd version of this file by Peeter -- it
		should fix b.g.o #74488.

2002-03-09  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* learn.c: Use the new min. match percentage while performing fuzzy
		queries in the learn buffer -- we shouldn't get too much away
		 from the original query string anyway and therefore the min.
		  match percentage can't be set to less than 25%.

	* syntax.c: Made a C++ style comment a C style comment -- we are using
		gcc who is quite strict on comment styles, so we should keep it
		 with the C comment style with '/*' and '*/'.

	* message.c: Show a very nice and make-the-user-happy-kind error window
		up if the message contains errorneus formats.

	* prefs.c: Added a toggle button for the formats checking voodoo -- the
		message does also say what you will get if the message has got
		 syntactical errors -- it will drive you crazy for sure; also
		  brought the min. match percentage option to daylight.

	* utils_gui.c: Made some small modifications for the instances checking
		routine of gtranslator -- it should a bit more safe now and the
		 message presented to the user is also a bit more clear now (at
		  least I hope so).

2002-02-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Make the charset selection non-changable by the user;
		could avoid some emberassed user emotions as one could think a
		 changed charset in the header edit dialog results in a recode
		  of the messages/po file at all -- it isn't so; you must use
		   the import/export dialogs for UTF-8 import/export for now.

2002-02-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: A small condition change for the modules routine (just some
		kind of "stylistics" action) and also bind the signal handler
		 to the "SIGKILL" signal created by calling "kill -9" or other
		  nice commands.

	* messages-table.c: Fix the problem with the Untranslated -> Translated
		status move for the translation insertion; also free up the 
		 inserted "found_translation" string (the "retrieval->message"
		  structure part should NOT be free'd as it would lead to a
		   crash: it's just a pointer to the _real_ message).

	* syntax-elements.h: Small update of the syntax highlighted elements &
		URL prefixes.

2002-02-27  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* messages-table.c: make right-click menu work, display selected
	message, unset fuzzy on insertion.
	* gui.c: update status of message in table whenever message changes.
	* message.c/.h: make gtranslator_message_show take a GtrMsg, not
	GSList
	* actions.c, learn.c, parse.c, replace.c: update.
	* comment.c: plug leak.

2002-02-26  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* htmlizer.c: Some more love for the HTMLizer routines -- we're now
		using the current colorscheme's colors for the single parts &
		 we are now also putting out some more information to the meta
		  tags of the written HTML file.

	* gui.c, stylistics.c & syntax.c/.h: Applied Peeter's patched files
		which should fix an editing bug; no one reported this bug in
		 fact yet however :-)

2002-02-20  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* color-schemes.h, learn.c & translator.h: Added newlines to the end
		of the header files -- should fix a compile problem with newer
		 gcc versions.

2002-02-19  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* messages-table.c: More sanity imported, the logic is right now, but
		the menu translation insertion step does still not work.

2002-02-18  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* messages-table.c: Don't call "gtranslator_message_update" after the
		insertion of any translation -- this would grep the shown and
		 not the really clicked-on message as the base for the actions;
		  still no salvation for the bug thereover that the menu does
		   not work like intended.

	* prefs.h: Removal of a non-used preference.

2002-02-17  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c & messages-table.c: Added update, status change etc. plays
		for the new translation insertion methods.

	* messages-table.c: Enable the popup menu also for fuzzy messages and
		smally re-format the non-successful learn buffer lookup message;
		 also enhanced the popup menu a bit more.

	* runtime-config.c: Get Pablo's idea into the reality -- woo'sh, it
		seems to be working like desired! Also added Pablo to the source
		 authors of "runtime-config.c" for his hint/code lines.

	* utils.c: Make the "gtranslator_utils_get_environment_charset" func.
		also safe for "C"/"POSIX" locales -- me is also happy now :-)

	* dialogs.c: Added "Query message contents" option to the query dialog;
		now you can directly query your learn buffer for the current
		 msgid.

	* gui.c, main.c: Create, show and delete the general colorschemes' list
		for the GUI menus; fixes b.g.o #71188.

	* color-schemes.c/.h: Adept the way we're creating the recent files'
		list and show the list of the colorschemes in the "_Settings"
		 main submenu.

	* runtime-config.c: Temporarily fix the compile problems by just setting
		the '^' in show -- there must be a way to let the original
		 source code lines compile; I just can't find it... a half-way
		  fix for b.g.o #70256.

	* menus.c/.h: Added "_Settings/_Colorschemes" menu subtree -- it'll be
		filled out by special "color-schemes.c/.h" functions like done
		 for the GtrHistoryEntry structures in the recent files' list.

	* syntax.c & utils_gui.c: Remove the "zpmd.h" includes as we've now
		moved the "special char" to the GtrRuntimeConfig structure.

	* gui.c & main.c: Create the colorschemes list once upon the GUI start
		and delete the colorschemes list subsequently on the GUI exit.

	* color-schemes.c/.h & prefs.c: Added "new" (it's been only moved)
		"gtranslator_color_scheme_create_schemes_list" function to get
		  the list of all available colorschemes; also added finally a
		   colorschemes list free'ing function (why didn't we have one 
		    yet?) named "gtranslator_color_scheme_delete_schemes_list".

2002-02-17  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* runtime-config.c: add missing includes and fix middot.
	* syntax.c, utils_gui.c: remove include "zpmd.h"

2002-02-17  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* runtime-config.c: Use the new function for the conversion call on
		the unicode'ified mid dot ('Â·').

	* utils.c/.h: Added a new "gtranslator_utils_get_environment_charset"
		function which returns the current environment locale's sane
		 encoding charset back.

	* syntax.c & utils_gui.c: Adept for the "special char" changes.

	* runtime-config.c/.h: Added a "special_char" field to this structure;
		the mid dot or other special char get's defined once on new
		 creation of the GtrRuntimeConfig structure now; I followed
		  Pablo's suggestion with small changes.

	* Makefile.am & zpmd.h: Removed this old-style file -- the mid dot or
		"special char" is now in the "GtrRuntimeConfig" structure.

2002-02-16  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* zpmd.h: Define the '^' to be translatable via _("^")[0] -- one never
		knows if even ASCII chars are ok as a "special char".

	* dialogs.c, main.c & prefs.c: Adept for the final "elimination" of
		our "beloved" query.c/.h source files -- renamings & removals 
		 of includes etc.

	* learn.c/.h: Added new "gtranslator_learn_(auto)translate" functions
		which are adaptions of the old "gtranslator_query_translate" &
		 "gtranslator_query_gtr_msg" functions -- the source lines are
		   simply pasted from the old query.c/.h source files.

	* Makefile.am & query.c/.h: Remove these old source files completely.

	* dialogs.c: Don't save the "query/" prefs/information anymore.

	* query.c/.h: Removed the GtrQuery structure and all related stuff;
		these source files should be obsolete quite soon, but for a
		 small time of transition they're still present.

	* dialogs.c & menus.c: Some slight textual modifications to reflect
		the current changes going on in the query field.

	* prefs.c & translator.c/.h: Remove the default query domain field of 
		the GtrTranslator structure/preferences.

	* dialogs.c, main.c & query.c: Remove the "domains" gettext domains
		list variable.

	* query.c/.h: Removed some old gettext-binded functions; many functions
		did go away as we do just work with the learn buffer now.

	* zpmd.h: Just added a "GTRANSLATOR_MIDDLE_DOT_FALLBACK" define which
		is currently just '^' -- a beginning of a fix for b.g.o #70256.

2002-02-15  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* utils.c: Check via "nautilus_strcasecmp" for the locale charset def &
		add some enhanced voodoo master plays for the charset getting
		 function "gtranslator_utils_get_locale_charset" -- fixes b.g.o
		  #69720.

	* syntax-elements.h: Added some specific stuff back (one should look at
		his code before doing any removal action I guess...).

	* message.c: Comment a very suspicious GTR_FREE out -- solves the status
		change bugs we've been reported about, e.g. b.g.o #61884.

	* comment.c/.h: Added new "gtranslator_comment_get_comment_contents" 
		function which returns the plain comment string.

	* gui.c: Updated/corrected the "Sticky" status printout on the status
		line -- it should be right now and explain what's up with the
		 "stickiness".

	* actions.c/.h, menus.c & message.c: Added new and easier to grep
		"Copy message -> translation" menu point -- this was previously
		  the "Sticky" message state functionality from the "Status"
		   menu -- it should be now much better to understand and use.

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am: Add the new pixmap file to the data files.
	
	* pixmaps/copy_msgid2msgstr.xpm: Added "new" pixmap -- also taken from
		Evolution (thanks to Jakub or to Tuomos? Surely to both :-))

2002-02-14  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* menus.c: Removed the "Sticky" message status from the status menu.

2002-02-11  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: Break the string freeze -- add a syntax highlighting pref.

	* prefs_init.c: Initialize the new preferences of the last time with
		sane values for the init process.

	* syntax.c: Also respect the "GtrPreferences.highlight" pref like the
		"nosyntax" gboolean from main.c in the syntax highlighting
		  function.

	* prefs.c/.h: Added "toggles/highlight" backend preference -- it's read
		and saved now, but isn't present in the GUI yet.. hmm.

	* utils.c: Extended the similarity calculating function with another
		piece of voodoo salt -- perfect taste not guaranteed ;-)

	* syntax-elements.h: Updated the keywords list with some useful words
		in the field of computing and removed a nonsense prefix.

2002-01-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* formats.c & learn.c: Applied Ryan Murray's multiline message patch
		to fix the build on the new gcc-3.0 series.

2002-01-26  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* query.c: Added 2 more assertions to avoid some crashes; still some
		room for humbling left over.

	* learn.c: Added a hash entry -> po file entry escaping function; now
		we should have a fully working fix/implementation for b.g.o
		 #61791 ("learn bufffer -> po file export"); also corrected/
		  improved some small parts of the exported po file's header
		   parts -- just some wording/punctuation changes.

	* syntax.c: Slightly more assertions to be a bit more safer -- won't
		crash that often now, but the syntax highlighting is now a bit
		 more wrong :-(

	* syntax-elements.h: While we're at it :-) Added some more common URI
		prefixes like "gnome-help:", "vfolder:" etc. and some keywords
		 about translation memory formats (of course, "UMTF" is now a
		  keyword :-)).

2002-01-25  Roy-Magne Mo <rmo@sunnmore.net>

	* syntax-elements.h: Adding gtranslator to keyword :) 

2002-01-25  Roy-Magne Mo <rmo@sunmore.net>

	* syntax.c: off by one in URL and keyword highlighting.

2002-01-24  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* syntax.c: Corrected a typo from Peeter in his last patch (it was:
		"prefixes[z]", but should have been "keywords[z]").

2002-01-23  Roy-Magne Mo <rmo@sunnmore.net>

	* messages-table.c: Needed to call e_tree_model_node_changed() to notify
			    the e_tree about the change. This fixed #66811 

2002-01-19  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Fix an almost impossible-to-think-of situation in the b.g.o/
		#68782 -- a multiple line msgstr with a multiple msgid and a
		  newline between the `msgstr ""' start token and the msgstr
		   contents -- would you have ever thought of it? We didn't :-)

2002-01-19  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* preferences.c/h: remove gtranslator_config_close() --
	gconf_client_suggest_sync should never be used, and then the function
	remains empty.
	* many .c files: do not call gtranslator_config_init() or close() --
	they are useless.
	* main.c: gtranslator_config_init() at startup, the only place it is
	needed.

2002-01-11  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove the "prefs-dialog.c/.h" source files.

	* translation-memory.c/.h: Also removed this (currently) non logical
		source files -- if Semerkent would be in a useable state, the
		 situation would look quite different, but it isn't :-/

	* prefs-dialog.c/.h: Removed this nonsense try of an own prefs dialog
		code.

	* menus.c: Changed the stock icon for the "Remove all translations" 
		menu entry to be now the "Trash" stock icon -- hopefully this
		 is a bit more intuitive then the previous "blank book" icon.

2002-01-10  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* menus.c: Changed the hotkey of the "_Edit/_Comment" menu entry to be 
		'o' -- doesn't clash with "_Cut" anymore.

2002-01-03  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Added newline after the message "Exported learn buffer..." --
		now the message looks sane on the command line .-)

	* learn.c: Enhanced the learn buffer exporting functionality by also
		"exporting" the resources list also to the exported po file.

	* menus.c: Added the "Edit comment" pixmap to it's menu entry .-)

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am & pixmaps/edit_comment.xpm: Added "Edit comment" 
		pixmap -- it was originally the "evolution/art/edit.xpm" from
		 Evolution.

	* comment.c: Enable/disable the new menu entry correspondingly to the
		"Edit comment" button in the comment view "component": it's
		  handled in the same function (& even in the same conditionals)
		   to be honest :-)

	* actions.c/.h: Added "ACT_COMMENT" action for the new "Edit/Comment..."
		menu entry; also removed the rests of the views bar: the "old"
		 ACT_VIEW_* actions are now removed from the sources.

	* menus.c: Added "Edit/Comment..." menu entry with "F9" as the keyboard
		shortcut.

2002-01-02  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* message.c: Included formats checking on message update -- it just
		beeps for now if a failure did occur, ergo the formats are
		 wrong or any other syntactical error is present.

	* prefs.c/.h: Added `hidden' "toggles/check_formats" preference via
		which you can enable the current formats checking routine --
		 it's currently not woven into the prefs dialog as the formats
		  checking needs some more love -- if you want to see it in
		   action, simply do:
		
		gconftool -t bool -s /apps/gtranslator/toggles/check_formats 1

	* formats.c: Hide the command line error messages/warnings from the
		user and return a really logical value -- it's the right way
		 now: it returns TRUE on success and FALSE on failure and not
		  vice versa.

	* about.c: Small tweak --  the colorscheme author is now "escorted" by
		"'s (I know, a "super" change ,-)).

	* messages-table.c: Made the default color values for the table entries
		highlighting being defined by macros -- centralizes their prefs
		 a bit -- still no clue about the "messages table doesn't show
		  up" bug .-( Uhmm...

2002-01-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* about.c: The about dialog is now much more well-proportioned then
		before -- should fix bugzilla bug #66815.

	* main.c: Added an "-e"/"--export-learn-buffer" option to use the new
		functionality from "learn.c".

	* learn.c: Implement the "exporting to po file" functionality.

	* syntax-elements.h: Added some more syntax highlighting patterns:
		"toc:" as URI prefix and "EURO", "Euro", "Cent", "Ct" as some
		  names for our new common European currency; for "equality" I 
		   did also add the "Dollar" to the list ,-)

	* Makefile.am: Added "zpmd.h" to the sources' list.

	* syntax.c & utils_gui.c: Include "zpmd.h" and call the new macro named
		GTRANSLATOR_MIDDLE_DOT instead of the (_("\xb7")[0]) struct;
		 this way we try to achieve some better i18n results.

	* zpmd.h: Define an external GTRANSLATOR_MIDDLE_DOT macro to outsource
		the middle dot definition & structure into an own header file;
		 why zpmd.h? Because it's a "_z_uper problematic middle dot.h"!

	* dialogs.c: (Ha, finally! Euros have come down ,-)) Check a directory
		for existence before completing in the file dialogue (bewares
		 you of "Directory: XYZ/po isn't readable" or similar errors).

2001-12-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* formats.c: Implement the formats checking routines with a quite
		"anormal" way to do it -- but it delivers us the result
		  whether the given message is correct or not.

2001-12-26  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c/.h, main.c & syntax.c/.h: Added Peeter to the authors' party
		at the top of every source file as work of him did go into
		 these source files.

	* prefs.c: Small typo correction ("message" <-> "messages").

	* Makefile.am: Removed po.c/.h from the sources' list.

	* po.c/.h: Removed these preliminary sources -- I don't think we wanted
		to get these source files to become alive ever.

	* about.c: Added Peeter to the about box' authors' section -- also
		changed the formatting of the mail addresses a bit (really just
		 a bit .-)).

	* utf8.c: The charset after the conversion to UTF-8 is now also "UTF-8"
		and not "utf-8" like it was previously.

	* languages.c: Change the Turkish encoding to "ISO-8859-9" to solve the
		problems the previously present string ("iso-8859-9") could 
		 cause with the compiled gettext po files (results of a long
		  thread in the GNOME Turk mailing list).

2001-12-25  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* learn.c: Small enhancements to the learn buffer -> po file exporting
		routines; more parts of it is written now, though not completed
		 yet.

2001-12-23  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gui.c: put comment view in scrolled window so that it doesn't
	get too high. Taken from patch by Peeter Vois <Peeter.Vois@mail.ee>
	* syntax.c: don't insert text if it's NULL.
	Still crashes on untransated messages

2001-12-23  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* prefs.c: Merge toggle button and entry of the following options:
		+ "Use special dictionary" and "Dictionary to use"
		+ "Save po files automatically..." and "Autosave timeout..."
		+ "Append a special suffix..." and "Autosave suffix"
	* utils_gui.c (gtranslator_utils_attach_toggle_with_label): use
	two columns for togglebuttons so that they don't make first column
	too wide (look at "Colors" page).

2001-12-23  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* prefs.h, prefs.c, parse.c: Removed "Don't save unchanged files"
	and "Warn if saving unchanged file" options: just don't save.

2001-12-22  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* views.c, views.h, sidebar.c, sidebar.h: removed views sidebar.
	* Makefile.am: don't build removed files.
	* find.c, gui.c, gui.h, parse.c, prefs.c, prefs.h: don't do anything
	with views sidebar.
	* menus.c, menus.h, actions.c: remove View menu.
	* gui.c: Insert undo should work even if dot char isn't used ;)

2001-12-20  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	Integrate parts of patch from Peeter Vois <Peeter.Vois@mail.ee>

	* syntax.c, syntax.h, gui.c, gui.h: rewrite syntax highlighting to be
	much faster and more correct.
	* dialogs.c, dnd.c, undo.c, utf8.c, views.c: update for syntax changes.
	* main.c: new option --nosyntax.
	* sidebar.c: dont ref/unref a NULL icon.
	* dialogs.c: don't set wmclass on already realized open dialog.

2001-12-20  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* prefs.c: deal with "show messages table" option the same way as
	others.

2001-12-20  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* menus.c: removed Options and Exit toolbar items.

2001-12-14  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* about.c: Added Roy-Magne Mo as an author .-)

2001-12-14  Roy-Magne Mo  <rmo@sunnmore.net>

	* languages.c: Corrected translation team for nn

2001-12-14  Roy-Magne Mo  <rmo@sunnmore.net>

	* about.c: Added functionality to add translators credit
	to fix #66812

2001-12-12  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.c: call e_tree_model_pre before
	changing the data in a node sice this is now required

2001-12-12  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* menus.c: Committed patches for #66814 & #66810 by Roy-Magne Mo 
		<rmo@sunnmore.net>.

	* learn.c/.h: Added the skeletons of a learn buffer -> po file export
		function (no sources, just prototypes).

2001-11-24  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* sidebar.c, message.c, gui.c: update messages table and show sidebar
	only if they are enabled.
	* find.c, message.c, header_stuff.c: do not use regex cache, replace
	it with regcomp	or simple str functions.
	* gui.c, main.c, parse.h, parse.c, sighandling.c: don't
	create/destroy regex cache.
	* gnome-regex.c, gnome-regex.h: removed -- no longer needed.
	* Makefile.am: remove these from build.
	* backend.c, bookmark.c, messages.h, parse.h: fix includes.

2001-11-21  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: #ifdef out the new percentage prefs stuff -- it isn't 
		working yet and so we just "hide" it from the user for now.

2001-11-12  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* messages-table.c: Applied a small 64 bit compiling fix as suggested
		by Ryan Murray <rmurray@debian.org>.

2001-11-10  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* utils.c: A small PowerPC compiling change -- smally changed version
		of the proposed patch by Ryan Murray <rmurray@debian.org> after
		 the bug report of Stephen R Marenka <stephen@marenka.net> --
		  gchar is an "unsigned" int on PowerPC: ok, why not..

2001-11-03  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* history.c: Applied a suggested crash patch from Volodymyr M. Lisivka.

2001-10-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: Small prefs string change to make the function of a toggle
		button more clear.

2001-10-26  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* stylistics.c: Applied supposed multibyte/font loading patch by
		Volodymyr M. Lisivka.

2001-10-19  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* save.h: Renamed the define to be now rightly "GTR_SAVE_H".

	* comment.c/.h: New "gtranslator_comment_hide" function to hide the
		comment view area.

	* prefs.c/.h & prefs_init.c: Added a new option to toggle the comment
		view -- fixes #59534.

2001-10-14  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* formats.c: Removed the old useless cruft for formats checking -- the
		sources are now emptied.

	* learn.c: Compress the XML document with the maximal factor 9 while
		saving -- should save much disk space for the users of big
		 learn buffers.

2001-10-12  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* languages.c: Changed the French language group's EMail address to
		be "gnomefr@traduc.org" instead of "traduc@traduc.org" as
		 suggested by "Olivier Berger <oberger@april.org>".

2001-10-11  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Applied suggested patch by Mike Newman to fix compilation
		of certain systems.

	* languages.c: Added a Catalan translation group EMail address as
		suggested by "Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>".

	* prefs.c: Implement a string change like suggested by Francisco 
		Petrucio Cavalcante Junior to a prefs option string.

2001-10-09  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* utils.c: Change the compiling processes temporary files to point to
		the general files dir "~/.gtranslator/files/".

2001-10-07  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* syntax.c, utils_gui.c & views.c: Applied some of Yukihiro's tips for
		#60350 -- maybe we're getting nearer to the solution of this
		 bug?!

	* gui.c: Discard the Ctrl+Shift+Arrow Key "key_press" events as these
		aren't the same like our navigation keys Ctrl+Arrow Key; fixes
		 #61822.

	* parse.c: Also un-escape the '\r' rightly -- fixes some warnings from
		badly formed messages in projects like XST.

	* save.h: Comment correction.

	* utils.c: Get the 1% float "gtranslator_utils_calculate_similarity"
		from the longer string of the two argument gchars -- seems
		 more logical.

2001-10-06  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.c: insert messages in the proper order

2001-10-06  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* utils.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_utils_calculate_similarity" function
		to calculate the similarity between two given gchar's -- it
		 does sound like voodoo, is voodoo and results like voodoo!

	* prefs.c: Split all learn buffer/auto translation options into an
		own prefs page and assure the gfloat values to be in sane
		 ranges -- makes prefs merging in some situations easier.

	* prefs.c/.h & prefs_init.c: Added minimum match percentage prefs.

2001-10-05  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am & \*.c/.h: Reflect the move of save-differently.c/.h to
		save.c/.h.

	* main.c: Some small reshuffles for the init/shutdown/free methods in
		the main() routine -- colorschemes and some other quite GUI
		 related stuff isn't loaded (and also not freed for this reason)
		  if we're only working in auto translation/learning modus on
		   the cmdline -- should give us some seconds and some memory
		    back for excessive auto translating/learning actions.

	* translator.c: Handle changes of language settings during the creation
		of the GtrTranslator structure -- a custom learn buffer name
		 for every language is now guaranteed -- after a restart of
		  gtranslator of course. Still not weaven into the learn buffer
		   code as this may cause some confusion ,-)

	* query.c: If we're using a "more detailed" locale like "no_NO" test
		the query domains directory for existence -- if it doesn't
		 exist try to fall back to a "major level" locale like "no".

	* learn.c: Set the changed status to TRUE if we're re-creating a new
		and fresh learn buffer -- else we don't get a new one if no
		 old learn buffer was previously present; also assign a more
		  secure premiereversion attribute for the GtrLearnResource
		   structures.

	* header_stuff.c: Ignore unknown, non-standard header entries silently.

2001-10-04  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* learn.c: Added "changed" gboolean field to the GtrLearnBuffer struct
		which makes us now a bit cleverer on learn buffer shutdown:
		 we don't need to save the learn buffer as a XML file, if there 
		  hasn't been any changes to the learn buffer -- should make
		   the gtranslator exit much faster in many circumstances.

2001-10-02  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* messages-table.c: Don't convert messages to UTF-8 if the messages are
		already UTF-8 per se -- should fix the bugzilla.gnome.org bug
		 #60839.

	* bookmark.c/.h: General re-organization of some parts -- it should be
		much more practicable now.

	* main.c: Completed command line auto translation option -- you can
		now use the auto translation feature without starting the GUI
		 at all via running "gtranslator -a po_file" -- you'd have got
		  to have a rich learn buffer for getting this to a really
		   quite useful state.

	* dialogs.c & query.c/.h: Added a gboolean "gui" argument to the
		"gtranslator_query_translate" function -- should be set to
		  TRUE if the functions is being called from the GUI circles
		   of gtranslator.

	* gui.c: A small correction in the non-visibility routines for the
		pane conents for the views sidebar and the messages table.

	* learn.c: Escape all necessary characters rightly for saving in the 
		XML document.

	* message.c: Check for the po file being open before showing any GtrMsg
		in the text boxes.

	* main.c: Added "-a/--auto-translate" command line options to auto
		translate a given po file on the command line without having
		 the GUI build up & started.

2001-10-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c & sighandling.c: Remove all backends on quitting/closing down
		gtranslator -- the backend informations are now also freed.

	* learn.c & main.c: Honor the new options while operating in the main
		routine for loading the backends and while querying the learn
		 buffer for the fuzzy matching option.

	* prefs_init.c: Initialize the new options to sane values and integrate
		them in the normal first init canon.

	* prefs.c/.h: New options to inhibit loading of backends on startup
		and to enable/disable "fuzzy matching" query methods for the
		 learn buffer.

	* prefs-dialog.c/.h: Add a "content" gpointer part which shall always
		point to the currently shown widget in the content area.

2001-09-30  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* learn.c: Some small enhancements and progress towards storing the
		learn buffer for UTF-8 (not done yet).

	* prefs-dialog.c/.h: Corrected all previously malformed macro casts and
		corrected some wrong assertions.

2001-09-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs-dialog.c: Slightly enhanced closure method -- also count the
		changes in the preferences through the "changed" method; show
		 a dialog to the user if changes are pending and the user still
		  wants to close the prefs dialog and respect the answer from 
		   this Yes/No/Cancel dialog.

2001-09-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs-dialog.c: Hm, check the "read_all_options_func" function for
		sanity before executing the eventually NULL-function.

2001-09-26  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added the new experimental po.c/.h source files to the
		sources list.
	
	* po.c/.h: New kind of GtrPo reading, saving etc. is currently played
		with in these very experimental source files.

	* prefs-dialog.c: Add a help button to the prefs dialog; also added 
		some more implementation stuff -- the creation needs now a
		 "read_all_options_func" argument which reads all the option
		   values from the widgets -- this way, we don't need to cope
		    directly with this in the prefs dialog sources.

2001-09-25  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added the new prefs-dialog.c/.h files to the sources.

	* prefs-dialog.c/.h: Added current GtrPrefsDialog implementation --
		needs some more extensions though before getting really useful:
		 I even don't want to think about memleaks yet ,-)

	* parse.h: Removed the conditional inclusion of config.h -- why got
		something like that into the header?!

2001-09-23  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* messages-table.c: Added a right click function which performs a
		query in the personal learn buffer if the right-clicked message
		 is currently untranslated and shows a found translation or an
		  informative message.

	* message.c: Honor the new option -- check for the option before 
		learning the newly translated message contents.

	* prefs.c/.h: Added toggle option to suppress auto learning of newly
		translated messages.

2001-09-18  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* bookmark.c, menus.c & utils.c: Fixed pure gpointer -> gint casts to 
		use the GINT_TO_POINTER macro from GLib.

2001-09-16  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* comment.c: Truncate the comment string if it's longer then 82 chars;
		thus avoid over-sized gtranslator window dimensions.

2001-09-10  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c & menus.c/.h: Renamed "the_popup_menu" to "the_main_popup_menu"
		to allow other popup menus to come without any name clashes.

2001-09-09  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* comment.c: Ehem, added a required assertion back.

2001-09-08  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c & menus.c/.h: Outsourced "the_popup_menu" menu entries into the
		common menu sources.

	* messages-table.c: Don't re-collapse the translated messages if we're
		on a untranslated message -- solves bug #60167 -- according
		 to the preference we're still collapsing the translated 
		  entries per default, but if we've uncollapsed the translated
		   entries once, we don't want to re-collapse the translated
		    entries again -- makes gtranslator slow on big po files.

	* utils.c: Applied an enhanced and changed version of Joe Man's patch
		(http://bugzilla.gnome.org/showattachment.cgi?attach_id=5071):
		  the logic is now kept and includes the enhancements from Joe
		   for the multibyte users.

	* comment.c: Removed an assertion checking for "file_opened" -- no
		comment can be shown at all if no file (and therefore no
		 message) is open/displayed! Also weakened an assertion to be
		  only a condition -- results in less spew on the console in
		   the "gtranslator_comment_display" function.

	* messages-table.c: Removed the assertion whether a file is opened in
		the "value_at" function -- it's not needed at all (fixes bug
		 #59539).

	* runtime-config.c: Adepted for the new directory: use the new location
		"~/.gtranslator/files/" for the "special" file(name)s during
		   converting/opening/saving "special" formats ,-)

	* utils.c: Also create a "files" directory in "~/.gtranslator" where
		all the temporary files should go; also don't remove the
		 crash file -- the user has to specify what to do for the crash
		  files.

	* bookmark.c, dialogs.c, history.c, main.c & parse.c: Adept for the new
		opening gateway function "gtranslator_open_file" which handles
		 all opening action now centralized -- no foo'sh constructs
		  anymore like "if(!gtranslator_open_po_file(filename)) {}"
		   etc.

	* open.c/.h: Integrate all opening logic into the new generalized
		"gtranslator_open_file" function -- makes source code
		  much more logical and replaces the double opening function
		   constructs used over many places in the code.

	* open.h: Changes comments and adepted the GTR_OPEN_DIFFERENTLY_H 
		define to follow the new name: GTR_OPEN_H.

2001-09-06  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* \*.c: Rename "open-differently.h" inclusions to "open.h" inclusions.

	* Makefile.am: Adapted for the open-differently.c/.h -> open.c/.h move.

	* parse.c: Fix #60091 -- a typo got into a changed message yesterday;
		fixed this.

2001-09-05  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c, header_stuff.c, menus.c, parse.c, prefs.c, replace.c &
		update.c & utils_gui.c: Corrected gramer and spelling murders
		 by me with the help of Mike's en_CORRECT patch .-)

	* dialogs.c: Eh, be a bit more clever in the save file as dialog:
		use project name + language if possible, if not use the
		 "project_name.po" as the prefilled filename for the save file
		   as dialog.

	* parse.c: Be also careful about the language name being non-existent
		in the save-temporarily-used file save case.

	* history.c: Escape the project name, version and the filename before
		showing the menu entries due to the "_" case -- the underscore
		 needs to be escaped as the they do else occur as hotkeys; also
		  be more careful about the project version when showing the
		   "Recent files" menu -- if no version is present or the 
		     default version "VERSION" is given, don't show any version
		      information in the "Recent files" menu.

	* about.c: Made the "Documentation:" and "Messages table:" author
		group labels translatable.

2001-09-04  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: If a message was fuzzy during translation removal set
		it's status to non-fuzzy afterwards in "remove_translation".

	* about.c: Added Emese Kovacs to the authors section for her
		documentation and "grouped" Kevin as the "Messages table"
		 representative exec developer ,-)

	* message.c: Free the comment via "gtranslator_comment_free" and
		not via a simple "GTR_FREE" in "gtranslator_message_free".

	* translator.c/.h: Small comments play and changing of the default
		learn buffer file name -- it is now named "Locale.xml";
		 also set the "natural_language_name" to English in the
		  "gtranslator_translator_new_with_default_values" function
		    as a fallback value -- fixes the last first init issues
		     left over due to the switch to GtrTranslator.

	* main.c: Only call "gtranslator_translator_new" if the general
		"gtranslator_translator" GtrTranslator structure hasn't been
		  inited by an eventual call of the first time init functions
		   yet.

	* prefs_init.c: Only use the new ultimate first time init function
		"gtranslator_translator_new_with_default_values" for getting
		  all the nice translator & language values.

	* parse.c: Adapted the "add to history" conditional to be based on
		the new GtrRuntimeConfig structure and to also ignore crash
		 and backend filenames.

	* main.c: Adapted to the new, changed function signature of the
		"gtranslator_htmlizer" function.

	* htmlizer.c/.h: Changed "gtranslator_htmlizer"'s arguments list:
		it just waits for the "save_to" filename to save the HTML file
		 to now -- uses the global "po" GtrPo structure.

	* parse_core.c & parse.c: Moved the "gtranslator_parse_main" into
		the main parse source file -- removed the old outsourced
		 parse_core.c file.

	* Makefile.am: Removed parse_core.c from the sources list.

2001-09-03  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse_core.c: Also include <config.h> conditionally.

	* prefs.c: Place the prefs dialog always in the center of the screen;
		fixes #59201 (I'd got to go back to GtkWindow level calls to
		 get this fixed; GnomeDialog level calls or the util function
		  "gtranslator_dialog_raise/show" aren't working here).

	* prefs_init.c: Heh, work with a local gchar string before going for
		bigger dimensions like a GtrTranslator -- fixes first init
		 values grepping.

2001-09-02  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c, gui.c & prefs.c: Some more mem leak hunting! Mainly
		addicted to "gtk_editable_get_chars" calls.

	* prefs.c: The "gtranslator_preferences_free" function now frees 
		really the left over gchar's which were all leaking 'round
		 -- the language, translator name etc. are now free'd by the
		  "gtranslator_translator_free" function.

	* prefs_init.c: Call up the new GtrTranslator structure based prefs
		init function "gtranslator_translator_new_with_default_values"
		 to get the default values for translator name, EMail.

	* dialogs.c, prefs.c/.h & query.c: Also moved the default query domain
		preference value now into the responsibility area of the 
		 GtrTranslator structure.

	* header_stuff.c, learn.c, prefs.c/.h, query.c, utils.c: Also switch
		to GtrTranslator use instead of the previous "mime", "language"
		 etc. variables for the language values.

	* header_stuff.c, learn.c & prefs.c/.h: Switched over to GtrTranslator
		use instead of "author" & "email".

	* gui.c, main.c & sighandling.c: Init/free the generally used 
		GtrTranslator structure "gtranslator_translator".

2001-09-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Welcome languages.c to our source files' list .-)

	* languages.c/.h: Put the languages list into a separate source file
		and use the header only for the declarations -- should've been
		 ever so.

	* main.c: Also adept this and changed the "successful learning" message
		a bit to be more correct -- typos, tsts.

	* dialogs.c, messages-table.c, open|save-differently.c & parse.c: Adept
		all these sources to the new GtrRuntimeConfig structure instead
		 of using the old way via calling 3, 4 different util functions
		  for this.

	* sighandling.c: Adept to the new GtrRuntimeConfig structure and
		free preferences, runtime config and regex cache on exit.

	* utils.c/.h: Removed the 4 "gtranslator_utils_get_*" utils functions
		which are now replaced by the GtrRuntimeConfig structure.

	* gui.c & main.c: Create/free the generally used GtrRuntimeConfig 
		"gtranslator_runtime_config".

	* Makefile.am: Plug in the new source files for runtime configuration.

	* runtime-config.c/.h: Added GtrRuntimeConfig structure for holding
		all kinds of runtime configuration -- for now, it stores the
		 names of the used temporary filenames -- replaces 4 utils
		  functions ala "gtranslator_utils_get_*".

2001-08-30  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* convert.c & undo.c: Include <string.h> to run fine with RH systems.

	* actions.c/.h: Renamed the "ACT_ACCOMPLISH" to "ACT_AUTOTRANSLATE" to
		also fit the new naming scheme.

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am: Adept the Makefile.am for the pixmap filename
		change.

	* pixmaps/auto_accomplishment|_translation.xpm: Moved the pixmap file
		also to the new naming scheme "auto_translation."

	* query.c/.h: Rename "gtranslator_query_accomplish" to the new scheme:
		"gtranslator_query_translate" is the new name.
	
	* dialogs.c/.h: Changed the dialog contents accordingly and renamed
		some dialog function names.
	
	* menus.c: Renamed "Autoaccomplish(ment)" to "Autotranslation" and
		changed the messages accordingly.

	* messages-table.c: Sticky messages are automatically also translated
		messages -- honor this in the message status updating
		 "gtranslator_messages_table_update_message_status" function.

	* main.c: 2 small typo fixes (taken over from Mike's en_GB.po .-)) and
		removed the "gtranslator won't load any backends" message --
		 as we don't get any module loading status messages, this 
		  should be quite clear to the user.

	* header_stuff.c, prefs.c, translator.c & utils.c: Reflect the member
		name changes of the GtrLanguage structure in <languages.h>.

	* languages.h: Renamed structure members for more clarity.

	* translator.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_translator_set_language" method
		for setting/changing the GtrTranslator's language values.

2001-08-29  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Eh, corrected a long outstanding and crazy bug in
		the "gtranslator_header_create_from_prefs" function: till now
		 we set the charset to the locale name; nothing very right to
		  do, so we do now the right thing(TM): set the charset from
		   the preferences.

	* backend.c/.h: Introduce a new type of functions: "BackendFunc" is now
		used for opening, saving, closing functions; via this, we are
		 now passing the backend functions' results directly back from
		  "gtranslator_backend_open" thus allowing us to see whether
		    the backend could open the file or not.

	* translator.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_translator_get_translator_string"
		and "gtranslator_translator_set_translator" functions for
		 easier handling with standard tasks in the area of the
		  GtrTranslator structure.

2001-08-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* about.c: Added Kevin & Thomas as co-authors to the About box.

	* translator.c: Finished implementation of all currently declared
		functions -- more are to come soon.

2001-08-28  Emese Kovacs <emese@gnome.hu>

	* prefs.c: Formatted the message box text a bit...

2001-08-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added translator.c/.h as sources to the gtranslator
		build.

	* translator.c/.h: Added the implementation for the defined functions
		except for the "gtranslator_translator_new_with_default_values"
		 function.

	* translation-memory.c/.h: Made the comments more explanatory for now
		(better then simply putting FIXME + some words into these
		  source files for now).

2001-08-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* translator.c/.h: Added GtrTranslator & co.'s preliminary sources.

2001-08-27  Thomas Ziehmer <thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* stylistics.c: To indicicate the end of the parameter list of
		g_strjoin NULL is required as last parameter (#59585).

2001-08-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* comment.c: Include <config.h> conditionally.

	* gui.c: Use "gtk_menu_popup" instead of the current (quite "bad")
		"gnome_popup_dialog_modal" + "gtk_widget_destroy" combination;
		  the popup menu doesn't get destroyed right after it's display
		   and also doesn't select "Open" by itself anymore ,-)

	* languages.h: Corrected another typo: "Belorussian" should be more
		appropriate then the old "Bielorussian".

	* dialogs.c & update.c: Corrected a typo: "occured" is bad, "occurred"
		is good .-)

	* dialogs.c: Added the real help text for the "Open from URI" help
		dialog -- it's also translatable now (fixes #59527).

	* color-schemes.c: Don't include <dirent.h> or <sys/types.h> anymore --
		we have got our own util function for doing the directory work
		 now and don't need these headers directly.

2001-08-26  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* utils.c: Fixes another quite nasty crash -- g_strdup the return value
		in "gtranslator_utils_get_locale_charset" so that we can free
		 it later on quite safely.

	* color-schemes.c, main.c & prefs.c: Fixed #59566 -- typo/mal-thinko
		"informations" corrected to be "information".

	* dialogs.c: Added Help button to the Open from URI dialog -- it's
		also checked in the if/else-tree; we need to decide how to
		 proceed for #59527.

	* prefs_init.c: Set the history length to 0 per init -- on the first
		startup gtranslator doesn't have got any recent files entries
		 yet -- fixes masses of "g_file_exists" assertions spewn out
		  on the console.

	* history.c: If we did get a <= 0 length for the history list, simply
		return NULL before operating any further.

	* prefs_init.c: Also assume English to be the default on "single"
		character locales (there ain't such things, right? Fixes
		 #59486 assumably); also check the parsed/grepped EMail
		  address to be longer then 6 characters like also requested
		   in the prefs dialog.

	* menus.c: Append "..." to dialog opening menu items' labels (fixes 
		#59529).

	* header_stuff.c & prefs.c: Adapted all the function calls for the new
		function signature: also let the language's group email be
		 editable -- everything other should be non-editable (fixes
		  #59485).

	* utils_gui.c/.h: Added "editable" gboolean argument to the
		"gtranslator_utils_attach_combo_with_label" util function.

2001-08-25  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: Also do the normal "gtranslator_open_po_file" function
		call to the file opening functions for the recover dialog.

2001-08-22  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Also update the status of a message in the messages tree on
		a message change on a fuzzy message where the status gets
		 "Translated" afterwards (according to the user preference).

	* message.c: Update the status in the messages tree according to the
		updated/changed status from the status setting menu entries.

	* parse.c: While constructing a more useful filename for a temporarily
		opened file check whether a project version is present before
		 using it in our filename construcing calls -- else use
		  "Project.Language.po".

2001-08-21  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.c (_update_message_status): new function to
	move a message from its old status group to its new one.

2001-08-21  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Enable the next untranslated menu entries after a remove all
		translations action (fixes #59301).

	* message.c: Also re-enable the remove all translations menu entries on
		a messages update (by filling in a translation for example) in
		 "gtranslator_message_update" (fixes #59300).

	* parse_core.c: Set the "locale_charset" field also for non-UTF8 files
		to gain a good result for the messages table translations -- 
		 thanks to Joe Man for pointing this out.

2001-08-20  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* learn.c: Escape the message and translation value strings into the
		right form before writing them via the libxml functions (fixes
		 #59205).

	* Makefile.am: Removed the $(GNOMEUI_LIBS) etc. inclusion during the
		linkage of gtranslator -- the GAL cflags and libs do already
		 include the GNOME(UI) cflags and libs.

	* messages-table.c/.h: Removed the useless hide/show/toggle functions.

2001-08-19  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: Show the preferences dialog centered via the
		"gtk_window_set_position" function (fixes #59201).

	* parse.c & update.c: "Enhanced" the "gtk_main_iteration" calls by
		conditionalizing them with "gtk_events_pending".

	* query.c: Redraw the messages tree if any autoaccomplishment 
		could be performed (fixes #59204).

2001-08-18  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs_init.c: Initialize the pane positions rightly during the
		first startup.

	* gui.c: Removed the pane position initialization per values.

2001-08-17  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* comment.c: Added C source comment prefix "* " with NO_COMMENT
		type to the internal comment prefixes -- the "* " parts
		 of source comments are now also strip'd out of the 
		  "pure_comment" part in a GtrComment.

	* parse.c: Added a missing "nothing_changes=FALSE" assignment on
		file closure -- fixes the weird behaviour of the actions
		 after closing a file and opening a file just after the
		  last closure -- the menu entries/toolbar buttons were
		   just not reacting right.

	* messages-table.c: Expand the tree if we're viewing an translated
		entry in the collapse-all-translated-entry modus -- fixes a
		 nasty crash with collapsed Translated entries tree.

	* main.c: Check here for some environment values which could give
		us a generally different locale directory to query all
		 domains for ("GTRANSLATOR_LOCALEDIR" and "GNOMELOCALEDIR"
		  are searched for values currently.).

	* query.c/.h: Declare the "domains" GList "extern" and declare it
		internally in query.c.

	* prefs_init.c & utils.c: Use the new function instead of using
		own crippled versions of the same function.

	* utils.c/.h: New "gtranslator_utils_get_environment_value" function
		which holds the new logic for getting a logical environment
		 variable value from a given defined "envpath" to search a
		  value for the variable from.

	* syntax.c: Fix a small error in Joe's multibyte code .-)

2001-08-17 Joe Man <trmetal@yahoo.com.hk>
 
 	* stylistics.c: Added #include <gdk/gdkx.h>
 		If multibyte font is detected, use orignial_font and the 
		 selected multibyte font to display the translated messages.
 	
 	* syntax.c: If multibyte character is found, don't perform syntax 
		highlighting, just append the multibyte character to the
		 translated message.

2001-08-17  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs_init.c: Cleaner logic during the language setting routines --
		directly set the values for "English" if we can't get any 
		 locale variable; also check some common values for the
		  translator/author/user name and EMail address and prefill
		   them in the prefs if any useful value could be found.

	* prefs.c: Some missing initializations of some gchar's to NULL.

2001-08-16  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* update.c: Iterate back to the main thread via "gtk_main_iteration":
		avoids lock of the main GUI while executing the update script.

	* convert.c: If we can't get an iconv_t base don't spew out any
		assertion warnings, simply return the given original string
		 silently.

	* parse.c: Removed the out-commented part about not counting sticky
		messages (they'ren't any sticky messages in po files yet) and
		 use "gtk_main_iteration" while using the core parse function
		  to avoid the GUI lockup.

	* history.c: Before checking the file for existence check the
		filename itself for existence.

	* messages-table.c: Include <config.h> conditionally.

	* prefs_init.c: After getting a locale, get the corresponding
		language name via the new function and set all the
		 nice and nifty prefs values for this language on
		  the first startup of gtranslator.

	* utils.c/.h: Added a language-values-in-the-prefs-setting
		"gtranslator_utils_set_language_values_by_language"
		  function -- sets encoding, character set, group
		   EMail etc. for the given language name from our
		    languages list; also removed an assertion from
		     the code.

	* main.c: Create the main gtranslator directory before reading
		in the preferences.

	* prefs.c: Also search the ~/.gtranslator/colorschemes directory
		for colorschemes, apply first the colorschemes there if
		 found -- the selection box does now also list the files
		  in the ~/.gtranslator/colorschemes directory -- should
		   be more user-friendly; also changed *str*cmp calls to
		    be nautilus_*str*cmp calls.

	* learn.c: Adjusted for the new home of the learn buffer file.

	* utils.c: Create a more-recursive directory structure in the
		~/.gtranslator directory -- we're now using the
		 "colorschemes", "etstates" and "umtf" subdirectories
		   there -- better for future expansion; adjust the
		    etspecs functions to return the now right filenames.

2001-08-15  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs_init.c: Don't initialize the language name -- let the 
		user fill in this data.

	* utils.c/.h: Also declare the language data lists "extern"al.

	* utils.c: Updated the language name getting routines to be a bit
		more logical, if no full match is possible, check the first
		 2 characters for equality (-> if "tr_TR" is not found,
		  check for "tr").

	* color-schemes.c/.h: Also made the generally used GtrColorScheme
		"theme" declared extern in the header.

	* prefs.c: Re-use the GTR_FREE macro while updating the prefs contents
		and also check for the EMail address length to be at least 6
		 characters long.

	* prefs_init.c: Set the default locale to "en" if nothing another
		could be determined -- also set the language name from the
		 locale code via the new utils function (solves #58832).

	* utils.c/.h: Removed 2 internal "g_warning" calls and added a new
		"gtranslator_utils_get_english_language_name_by_locale_code"
		  function and changed some "strcmp" calls to 
		   "nautilus_strcmp" calls.

2001-08-11  Thomas Ziehmer <thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c, prefs.h: Code cleanup and fix of a potential bug with global
		variables, which were not really global.

2001-08-14  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* comment.c: Comment tweaks -- nothing changed in source, just some
		newlines, breaks at some really bad to read places.

	* prefs_init.c: Set the found locale setting (or the default "en_US")
		while initializing the first time settings (grr, this was the
		 main reason why the crash during first time initialization
		  occured.

	* prefs.c: Made "Miscellaneous" page tab translated again -- grr, how
		did this get un-prefixed by "_("; also set the value to NULL 
		 while updating the prefs contents; corrected a typo in a
		  "gtranslator_config_get_bool" call for the "collapse all
		    translated entries" option.

2001-08-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: Check whether any translator name, EMail address was
		entered in the prefs dialog -- give us an error if not;
		 also check the scheme filename before checking, applying
		  it.

	* prefs_init.c: Initiliaze the colorscheme name + filename with
		"default.xml" and also init the "text_bg" attribute to
		 "white" per default like in "default.xml".

2001-08-11  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* messages-table.c: Corrected the untranslated count bug (thanks to 
		Kevin for pointing this out); also made the ETree respect the
		 new option for collapsing all translated items per default.

	* prefs_init.c: Set the new option per default to TRUE.

	* prefs.c/.h: Added another option for collapsing all the translated
		entries per default.

	* open|save-differently.c, parse.c & update.c: Made the file names all
		be enclosed in single-ticks (') -- should be more safe and 
		 secure.

	* messages-table.c/.h: Added the new "read/free_messages_table_colors"
		functions, which are setting up/freeing the colors for the
		 groups in the messages tree -- they use default values if the
		  user doesn't want customized colors; the colors are read in
		   from the preferences (-> you can define the colors there
		    via the GnomeColorPicker's).

	* prefs.c/.h: Added eighth page with messages table settings -- toggling
		the table and special colors for the table groups can be defined
		 from there -- the prefs reading, writing is done, too.

	* prefs_init.c: Initialize the standard color values for the messages
		table on the first startup.

	* stylistics.c/.h: Added COLOR_MESSAGES_TABLE_* color types and expanded
		"get_path_from_type" to resolve these new enumeration values.

	* sidebar.c: Only show up the views group for now -- bookmarks need more
		work & integration -- maybe for 0.40 ,-)

	* messages-table.c: Display the count of left fuzzy, untranslated messages
		in the grouping column; also show the fuzzy entried red and the
		 untranslated entries in the "evolution important" color.

	* undo.c: On missing "text" don't print out a warning -- simply return.

	* gui.c: Moved the messages table to the middle of the GUI -- should
		look much better now.

2001-08-10  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Add bold text and color to the tree. Edit value at function to change 
	the colors.
	
	* messages-table.h: add enums for bold and color columns
	
	* messages-table.c (.table_extras_new ): do the gtk_object_set on the 
	string columns.
	(value_at_function): show the status headers as bold. Make the entries 
	red if the status is untranslated.

2001-08-11  Thomas Ziehmer <thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* utils.c: There was a problem in reading a dos file, because
		after reading \r or \n gtranslator_utils_getline stopped
		and the other character was read alone, which got an
		empty line.

2001-08-10  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* messages-table.c: Translate the column names and "group" names into
		UTF8 via "e_utf8_from_locale_string" for proper display on
		 locales.

	* undo.c: The position for the undo could also be 0 so that we check
		the position for being ">= 0" in "gtranslator_undo_run_undo",
		 also activate the ACT_UNDO action on any registering of an
		  undo action.

	* gui.c: Also clean the "Undo" register on file closure; bind the
		"insert/delete_text_handler"s to the new undo mechanism.

	* messages-table.c: Removed a debug "g_print".

	* message.c: Clean up "Undo" stuff on message navigation.

	* actions.c: Disable the "Undo" actions on an undo -- also check the
		new "cleverer" gtranslator_undo_* stuff before using the old
		 and beloved simple undo mechanism ,-)

	* actions.c/.h & menus.c: Ha, take that, cruel Redo!

	* undo.c/.h: Yes, I did it, I did bring the sources in organization for
		working Undo: Redo is dropped out of gtranslator sources.

	* prefs.c: Only store the option value directly for the messages table
		visibility -- changes require a restart to take effect -- 
		 avoids tons of problems.

	* gui.c, messages-table.c & parse.c: Respect the option for toggling
		the messages table visibility.

	* messages.h: Comments clarification -- a small explanation for the 
		sticky "GTR_MSG_STATUS_STICK" enumeration value -- it's just
		 virtual for now and the comment explains this.

2001-08-10  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.c (..messages_table_new): change signal connect
	to "cursor_activated".
	(row_selected): now check to see if a new message has been selected.
	If not then don't call ...message_go_to. This means that navigating
	the tree with keyboard will now change messages. It also fixes 
	the infinite looping that happened before with "cursor_activated".

2001-08-10  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.c: slightly ugly hack to display status headers
	and the messages as child nodes. Add three ETreePaths as global
	variables for the different status. 
	(value_at_function): check if the node is a status header and give
	to corresponding value
	(..messages_table_create): create the three status header nodes.
	Add the messages to the proper status node instead of the root node.
	Sticky messages do not get added.
	(row_selected): do not emit warning if message is NULL. Instead
	that means the user clicked on the status header.
	(table_extras_new): "original" column is now a tree column.

2001-08-09  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Previous last translator save and holding routine
		added; if the last translator changes, the previously last
		 translator's credits go into the header comment in the well-
		  known standard form TRANSLATOR <EMAIL>, YEAR. -- but only
		   if the translator's name isn't listed in the header 
		    comment yet.

	* main.c & preferences.c: Removed the "GCONF_IS_PRESENT" conditionals
		-- we do now depend on GConf, so no need to conditionalize the
		 configuration access routines.

	* header_stuff.c: Fixed header commentless po files' parsing -- we add
		a "# " header comment to the po file if no header comment is
		 currently present.

	* message.c: More checks in "gtranslator_message_status_set_fuzzy" --
		3 more "g_return_if_fail"s.

	* header_stuff.c & utils.c/.h: Moved the "language_in_english" function
		to "gtranslator_utils_get_english_language_name".

	* actions.c & parse.c: Don't activate the "Remove all translations"
		menu entry on file opening by itself -- only activate it if
		 there are any translated or fuzzy messages.

	* parse.c: Check the messages count after the removal of all 
		translations -- if none has been left, disable the menu entry.

	* learn.c: Use this new function instead of an own local implementation.

	* utils.c/.h: Added new "gtranslator_utils_strip_all_punctuation_chars"
		function.

2001-08-08  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Implemented the remove all translations functionality --
		clear and rebuild the messages table on removal of all 
		 translations.

	* sidebar.c: Updated to be in sync with CVS GAL -- the logic for the 
		sidebar item creation is a bit changed now.

2001-08-07  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_remove_all_translations" core function
		skeleton.

	* prefs_init.c: Initialize the "Remove all translations" option to 
		FALSE -- it should only be visible on special user pref,
		 shouldn't be on by itself.

	* dialogs.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_remove_all_translations_dialog"
		function/dialog creation routine.

	* actions.c/.h: Added the corresponding action enumeration value
		"ACT_REMOVE_ALL_TRANSLATIONS" for the new function/ability.

	* menus.c: Added the new menu entry for this new action/option
		in gtranslator.

	* prefs.c/.h: Added an option to toggle the "Remove all translations"
		ability.

	* learn.c: Act cleverer on the (secondard in fact) query -- strip out any 
		punctuation character from a pre-defined array -- could be much
		 better for the auto accomplishment functions.

	* dialogs.c: Enhanced the edit comment dialog a bit -- if the comment
		prefix "#" is missing we do now prepend it; so we do get
		 always right and well-formed comments -- even if the user did
		  make something wrong in the edit dialog.

	* color-schemes.c: If we couldn't get a "text_bg" attribute use the
		"bg" attribute instead -- avoids possible problems with older
		  colorschemes.

	* preferences.c: Made the date string non-translatable as it's only
		used internally and is nowhere shown to the user.

	* about.c, dialogs.c, htmlizer.c, main.c & utils_gui.c: Comment
		corrections, removals to make the po files lighter as the
		 source comments above the translatable messages weren't
		  very useful in some cases.

2001-08-06  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.c (_messages_table_clear): fix the bug where
		value_at_function was called after a table clear. Insert
		a root node to e-tree after clearing it instead of setting
		it to NULL. Why this fixes it? I don't have a clue.

2001-08-06  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* comment.c: Corrected the comment type recignition to also use the
		fields -- source code comments should also be editable.

	* gui.c: Connect the signal for clicking on the "Edit comment" button
		to the new edit comment dialog.

	* dialogs.c/.h: Added comment edit dialog -- quite simple and small
		but working.

	* utils_gui.c: Only connect the "changed" signal for the text box
		if a callback has been given at all.

2001-08-03  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* update.c: Rightly catch the return values -- the result of the
		"system" call is 8-bit encoded, therefore we need a bit-shift
		  to get the real value.

	* undo.c: Some more free actions -- surely there are tons of bugs in
		these very less lines.

2001-08-02  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* undo.c/.h: Re-animation of some dead code -- again a crippled
		variant of my most favourite task in gtranslator..

	* utils.h: Also set the free'd variable to NULL in the "GTR_FREE"
		macro.

	* messages-table.c: The fuzzy messages case is the last case in the
		switch tree now and is the default (no other types are left
		 to be returned).

	* parse.c: Check for the FUZZY_COMMENT status bit instead of
		plain type equality.

	* comment.c/.h: Combine the type fields of a GtrComment -- fuzzy
		message recognition should be working again now.

2001-08-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* message.c: Use the list data instead of the list pointer within the
		"gtranslator_messages_table_select_row" function call in
		  "gtranslator_message_go_to".

2001-07-31  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.c (_messages_table_new): hook up to the
		"click" signal to get select_row working.
	(row_selected): check to see that the left mouse button
		did the clicking
	(row_selected): get the model_row from the message number instead
		of g_list_index. Speeds things up a bit.

2001-07-31  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Call up "gtranslator_messages_table_select_row" when
		navigating with the old "style" via toolbar buttons, menu
		 entries or via keyboard.

	* messages-table.c: Erh, some little crash cure -- there's still a
		problem somewhere (after file closures the "value_at_function"
		 is called -- bad).

	* comment.c: Always show the comment, always let the pane fit the needed
		space and simplified the "gtranslator_comment_display" function.

	* sidebar.c: Adapted for the missing comment view -- less items in
		the EGroupBar.

	* find.c: Don't try to show the comment as a view -- the comment view
		is now removed -- simply go to the message where the found text
		 is in the comment.

	* gui.c, menus.c & views.c/.h: Removed the comment view option, related
		code -- the comment is already viewed permanently, so there's no
		 need for an extra view.

	* prefs_init.c: Init the messages table option with TRUE -- the table
		should be visible on first startup.

	* prefs.c/.h: Added "show_messages_table" option to GtrPrefences and
		preferences -- not fully integrated into source yet.

2001-07-30  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: We don't need any toggle button in the auto accomplishment
		dialog -- the corresponding setting has gone into the prefs.

	* prefs.c: Also save the GtrPreferences.use_learn_buffer variable
		on apply and added another toggle button for the learn buffer
		 usage preference.
	
2001-07-30  Thomas Ziehmer <thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* sighandling.c: Fix bug #58267 and set signalscount to 1 inside
		gtranslator_signal_handler.

2001-07-30  Thomas Ziehmer <thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* sighandling.c: gtranslator will no longer crash, when a signal
		arrives and no file was open

2001-07-30  Thomas Ziehmer <thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* messages-table.c: right justify number and line
	
2001-07-29  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* history.c: Really respect the defined maximal history entries count
		from the preferences -- the if condition for the break in the
		 save routine was not fully right -- it had got to be ">"
		  instead of ">=" to also get the last wanted history entry.

	* Makefile.am: "pixmaps" is now again a subdirectory of src .-)

	* menus.c: Use the "new" pixmaps for the auto accomplishment and query
		menu entries and toolbar entries.

	* pixmaps/*: Added auto accomplishment and query pixmaps (including
		Makefile stuff for it) -- the icons are taken from Evolution.

	* dialogs.c: Some more logics for the learn buffer toggle button.

	* utils_gui.c: Check if the signal is given for the "_attach_toggle"
		utility function before connecting it.

2001-07-23  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* backend.c/.h: fixed a crash, when open a file after an other
		file failed to open.

2001-07-23  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: Implemented the extended autoaccomplishment per dialog
		(yes, the new toggle button there is really useful .-)).
	
	* prefs.c/.h & prefs_init.c: Initialize, read and use the new
		"toggles/use_learn_buffer" preference -- per default it's TRUE.

	* query.c/.h: Use the learn buffer also for the autoaccomplishment
		routine -- the "use_learn_buffer" argument is now quite
		 important .-)

2001-07-22  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* utils.c: Language env. variables order change due to the suggestion
		by Pablo Saratxaga.

	* messages-table.c/.h: Added COL_LINE enumeration value and renamed
		some enumeration values; integrated the line number display
		 via "COL_LINE" and "line" cells/enumeration values.

	* messages.h, messages-table.c & parse.c: Added "no" field to GtrMsg
		which holds the number of the message in the po file -- set
		 the entry on parse time and show it in the table instead of
		  the line number like before.

	* dialogs.c/.h & utils_gui.c/.h: Moved/renamed the "gtranslator_error"
		function to "gtranslator_utils_error_dialog" and put it into
		 utils_gui.c/.h.

	* backend.c & utils.c: Supply the additional argument to the changed
		function call.

	* utils.c/.h: The "gtranslator_utils_free_list" function now does also
		take a "free_contents" gboolean argument to determine whether
		 the contents should also be freed.

	* prefs_init.c: Set the language name on startup from the environment
		variables if possible.

	* query.c: Use the new function instead of own environment crippling
		actions...

	* utils.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_utils_get_environment_locale" which
		returns any found environment locale (searches $LC_ALL, $LANG,
		 $LANGUAGE and $LC_MESSAGES for this: the special
		  $GTRANSLATOR_LANGUAGE is also searched for some crazy cases .-)).

2001-07-21  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* messages-table.c: Make the "gtranslator_messages_table_select|update_row"
		more sane -- check for the message argument and operate on
		 the ETree only if there's the ETreePath node determined.

	* parse.c: Update the row contents on "gtranslator_message_update"
		to get an updated display of the table.

	* backend.c & parse.c: Some more sanity checks and assertions.

	* backend.c/.h: Added "module" GModule pointer to the GtrBackend
		structure and added it to the handling routines -- needs
		 still much love.

	* prefs_init.c: Initialize some more values for the default startup
		options.

	* formats.c: Extended the formats recognition functions a bit;
		don't check for %POS$FORMAT formats in msgid's -- there
		 shouldn't be any!

	* \*.c: Use the new GTR_FREE, GTR_ITER and GTR_STRDUP macros
		where possible -- should get some stuff more stable.

	* backend.c/.h: Changed the "gtranslator_backend_remove"
		function to take a "GtrBackend *backend" argument and
		 implemented the function itself to be a free function
		  => rename to "gtranslator_backend_free" and freeing
		   of backends data members.

	* utils.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_utils_free_list" function
		which frees list data & the list itself quite safely;
		 also adde the two ultimate macros GTR_FREE and GTR_ITER
		  which replace really common constructs among the code.
	
		And: the ultimate GTR_STRDUP macro did also land in utils.h!

	* gui.c: Save the tree state on "gtranslator_quit" and changed the
		default table_pane_position to be 82 pixels -- should be
		 better now.

	* messages-table.c: Inserted two additional assertions for
		more saneness.

	* parse.c: Clear the table on file closure.

2001-07-20  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.[c,h] (_table_clear): new function to
		clear the e-tree and hash table.

2001-07-20  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.[c,h] (_table_create): remove the call
		to g_list_copy as it wasn't needed

2001-07-20  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.[c,h] (_select_row): fix typo. Change
		_message_table_select_row to _messages_table_select_row.

2001-07-20  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table[c.h] (_select_row): new function to select
		an e-tree row based on the message.

2001-07-20  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* messages-table.c: GTR_MSG_STATUS_UNKNOWN => message is
		untranslated (corrected the display string) and made
		 the translation returning function respect missing
		  translations -- no reason to spawn masses of failed
		   assertions.

	* parse.c: Fill the messages table on parse-time.

	* gui.h/.c: Added messages table widget, pane etc.

	* bookmark.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_bookmark_get_list" function
		to get a copy of the internally used bookmarks' list.

	* learn.c: Implemented a fallback query modus to get a better
		matching rate for the searched strings; sort the resources
		 on the <index> part according to their index value:
		  introduces new "gtranslator_learn_buffer_sort_learn_resource"
		   GCompareFunc function.

	* messages-table.c: Display the _translated_ status strings
		capitalized in the messages table .-)

2001-07-18  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.c (value_at_function): for fun display
	an untranslated string for the status column.

2001-07-19  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Small comment changes -- nothing changed in source.

	* learn.c: Removed the own "gtranslator_learn_set_xml_prop"
		function and used the gal "e-xml-utils.h" functions
		 for some XML work; added index' reading/writing and
		  resources' addition on learning.

	* formats.c: Implemented formats checking -- the %POS$FORMAT
		formats and some Nautilus msgid's are driving me nut-bags
		 though.

	* sighandling.c: Also flush the runtime config. key "runtime/filename"
		for the instances checking on "abrupt" exit.

	* messages-table.c: Supplied the statusfile argument for the
		e_tree_save_state call in the
		 "gtranslator_messages_table_save_state" function;
		   also display the message's pure comment.

2001-07-18  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.c (value_at_function): Do the utf8 thingy
		for the translated string in order for it to
		 display properly in the e-tree.

2001-07-18  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.[c,h] (_save_state): New function to
		save the e-tree state. Also load the state in
		 messages_table_new. Commented out until someone
		  else determines where to save this.

2001-07-18  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.c: add a hash table to associate an
		ETreePath with each message. Use it in update_row
		 so that function now works.

2001-07-18  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* backend.c: Let the status feedback about the backend loading
		get translated as well as the backend description.

	* Makefile.am: Plugged in the new formats.c/.h sources.

	* formats.c/.h: New sources for formats check -- isn't fully
		done yet.

2001-07-17  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.[c,h]: renamed _messages_table_update to
		_messages_table_create.

2001-07-18  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* backend.c & main.c: Changed 2 "g_message" calls to be "g_print" calls.

	* messages-table.c/.h: Added Kevin to the source file authors' list .-)

	* main.c: Added "--learn"/"-l" option to learn a po file completely from the
		commandline without starting the GUI.

	* gui.c: Flush the "runtime/filename" configuration key for the current file
		name on exit as well as well as on file closure.

	* learn.c/.h: Added "public" function "gtranslator_learn_po_file" which
		"learns" the given GtrPo's messages completely (only the translated
		  messages of course); also added the necessary GFunc for this.

	* syntax.c: Integrate the "text_bg" color into the syntax insertion method.

	* stylistics.c/.h: Added the new enumeration value "COLOR_TEXT_BG" and did
		integrate it into the sources (it's for the new "text_bg" field of
		 the GtrColorScheme).

	* color-schemes.c/.h: Added "text_bg" field to the GtrColorScheme structure
		and respected it everywhere in the code -- we don't assume any
		 "text_bg" occurence though -- many if's should avoid pre-"text_bg"
		   age colorschemes crashes.

	* comment.c: Stored & restore the "sane" pane position if an oversized
		and displayable comment is shown; also made only translator
		 comments enable the "Edit comment" button.

2001-07-17  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.[c,h] (gtranslator_messages_table_update_row): New
	function to update the e-tree row. Doesn't work right now as
	I need to find a way to determine the ETreePath associated
	with a message. Probably a hash table will do.

2001-07-17  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.c (messages_table_new): hook up to
	row selected signal of e-tree

	* messages-table.c (row_selected): new function when a row
	is selected will set the corresponding message to be the
	current.

2001-07-17  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* messages-table.c: convert the e_table_simple to
		e_tree_memory*

	* messages-table.c (gtranslator_messages_table_update): new
	function to clear the table and populate it with the messages

2001-07-17  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* comment.c: Activate the "Edit comment" button if we've for a
		translator comment or a source comment (any other cases should
		 not be editable).

	* comment.c, gui.c & parse.c: Removed all the EEntry stuff, use
		GtkLabel calls everywhere -- changed includes a bit to be
		 right after the EEntry -> GtkLabel move for the comment area.

	* gui.c/.h: Changed the comment show area to be a GtkLabel, added
		"Edit comment" button which will allow editing of a translator
		  comment later on; use a new GtrExtraContentArea structure
		   to get all the widgets into the pane area. Create/free the
		    structure/area widgets.

	* comment.c/.h: Removed the "gtranslator_comment_is_visible" function
		and integrated the funcs into the "gtranslator_comment_display"
		 function; added a "pure_utf8_comment" part to the GtrComment
		  structure and adapted the function respect this new portion
		   in the GtrComment structure. Also corrected the prefix
		    snipping to work and use "nautilus_str_replace_substring"
		     instead of "nautilus_str_get_after_prefix" -- now the
		      prefix'es get cut.

2001-07-16 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

        * message-table.h: add enum for the e-table columns

        * message-table.c: begin to properly do the e-table stuff.
        Add case statements for most of the functions to do the proper
        stuff depending on the column

2001-07-17  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Fixed a cast problem -- UTF-8 editing should work again.

	* utf8.c: Fixed exporting of po files -- the author name and the
		eventually existing header comment are now also exported
		 to UTF-8.

	* learn.c: Added "gtranslator_learn_set_xml_prop" util function to
		set XML props safely; also respect the found encoding while
		 writing the XML document and set the encoding attribute
		  accordingly to get a well-structure XML document. Also
		   make the parsing code work.

2001-07-16  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* learn.c: Restructeral, use a new GtrLearnBuffer structure and data
		for all operations; changes to almost all functions to make
		 them usable with the new structure, more sanity checks
		  throughout the whole code.

2001-07-15  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* learn.c: Small formatting changes.

	* comment.c/.h: Removed the "gtranslator_comment_show_references"
		function skeletons and made the EEntry not be editable -- ever.

	* parse.c: Another sanity check more -- check the comment before adding
		it to any obsolete entries string.

	* utf8.c: Two more g_return_if_fail's -- less crashs -- ehm, UTF8 is
		still not working.

2001-07-14  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* syntax-elements.h: Added some more standard filenames to the keywords
		and 2 other URI types/prefixes to the highlight words' list.

	* parse.c: Clean up any text lungering 'round in the comment entry
		on file closure.

	* bookmark.c/.h: Small rename fullfillings, move of the bookmarks
		list "gtranslator_bookmarks" into the source file and addition
		 of a "gtranslator_bookmark_open" function to open a bookmark.

	* sidebar.c: Added "Bookmarks" category to the sidebar model.

	* prefs.c: Corrected a malformed label (the compile result file is of
		course "project-name.gmo").

	* learn.c: Properties order change (language code comes before EMail),
		also write out "name" property for the <language> node and
		 read/write the serial nodes.

2001-07-14  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* learn.c: simplified kabalaks solution

2001-07-14  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* learn.c: Compile fix -- initialize the variables in any case.

2001-07-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Also honor the new option to remove or not remove the compile result
		file.

	* utils.c/.h: Honor this new option in "gtranslator_utils_remove_compile_files"
		with a new argument "output_file".

	* prefs_init.c: Init the new option to TRUE on first init.

	* prefs.c/.h: Added toggle item/preference with which you can define whether
		the compile result file should be cleaned or not.

	* gui.c: Change order in "gtranslator_quit" so that the learning system
		gets shut down before the preferences are freed -- else we'd
		 forget using author/language specific informations in the learning
		  system's shutdown code (which simply saves an UMTF file).

	* message.c: Use the new function call structure for the
		"gtranslator_learn_string" function.

	* learn.c/.h: Made the learn sources use UMTF files as backends and use
		GHashTable's internally -- also changed some function signatures
		 slightly.

	* Makefile.am: Honorize the new source file names.

	* id.c/.h => bookmark.c/.h: Big rename to make it's function clearer.

2001-07-09  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Variable-ize the translation memory sources.

2001-07-08  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* message.c: Show the comments via the "gtranslator_comment_display"
		function.

	* comment.c: Implemented "gtranslator_comment_display" function.

	* query.c: Try to get the locale environment if no language is set yet
		in the preferences; check for "LANGUAGE" first and then for
		 "LANG" if no "LANGUAGE" is set; if even that doesn't succeed
		   then we're lost.

	* utils.c & prefs.c: Small first startup fixes: some more assertions,
		checks, sanity calls and fallback mechanisms.

	* gui.c/.h: Renamed "extra_content_views" to "extra_content_view" and
		made all changes according to the removal of the content pane
		 option; use an EEntry for the extra content stuff.

	* prefs.c/.h: Removed all options concerning the showing of the content
		pane and made the language name also being set correctly on
		 locale code change.

	* messages-table.c: Make the table non-editable and made some small
		formatting changes.

	* utils_gui.c: Make combo boxes' entries non-editable.

	* parse.c: Check the percentage before applying the value on the
		progress bar for sanity.

2001-07-07  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Resolved the memory leak while writing the messages due
		to a small reorganization in the writing logic; also corrected
		 the malformed obsolete entries saving line(s).

	* messages.h: Use GtrComment as comment structure instead of a simple
		gchar.

	* find.c, header_stuff.c, message.c, replace.c & views.c: Changes
		according to the usage of GtrComment.

2001-07-03  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Honor the options/preferences for the content pane and store
		the ETable specification on quit.

	* prefs.c: Added messages table showing option to the prefs page.

	* messages-table.c/h: Added the new status field & show/hide/toggle
		functions like for the sidebar.

2001-06-29  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Use the newly created messages' table: still foo'sh but more
		finished.

	* messages-table.c/.h: Added new messages table sources which are based
		upon ETable.

	* Makefile.am & defines.config: Added ETSPECS_DIR define for the
		etspec files holding directory; also added the new messages-table
		 sources to the build.

2001-06-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs_init.c: Enable the sidebar/content pane per default.

	* gui.c/.h: Sidebar/Content pane enabling/disabling, position saving
		& restoring are now implemented; renamed some wrongly named
		 widgets and added the content pane widget with a temporarily
		  label .-)

	* sidebar.c: Made the show/hide functions for the sidebar work;
		also added configuration changes for the sidebar interna.

	* update.c: Always show the update dialogs -- there's no toggle
		variable for that anymore.

	* prefs.c/.h: Added sidebar toggle item and removed uzi dialogs
		toggle item; also added the content pane variable and
		 it's saving/restoring lines.

2001-06-25  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* undo.c/.h: Added sample functions structure for the undo
		calls -- source isn't written yet.

	* comment.c/.h: Changed function types a bit and added
		FIXME outputs -- source is explanatory and needs much
		 love.

2001-06-22  Christophe Merlet <redfox@eikonex.org>

	* languages.h: Updated email of the french team.

2001-06-22  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Added some signals handled by the signal handler
		and removed the double enumeration of SIGSEGV.
	
	* sighandler.c: Don't print anything out on an unknown
		signals -- don't differentialize any signal, simply
		 backup the file if it's been changed.

2001-06-21  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* languages.h: fixed typo

2001-06-19  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* languages.h: Added Esparanto & Malay, updated/corrected
		mailing list addresses for Japanese & Slovak.

2001-06-18  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gtkspell.c, gtkspell.h: update GtkSpell to CVS version from
	sourceforge. it should fix #55662.
	But obviously syntax handling of gtranslator is bad, and does not play
	well with gtkspell.

2001-06-18  Ole Laursen  <olau@hardworking.dk>

	* languages.h: Fixed Danish team address.

2001-06-18  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* open/save-differently.c & utils_gui.c/.h: Changed the programatic
		"gtranslator_utils_check_program" to be more i18n-friendly --
		  use 2 different messages for the decompression/compression
		   message -- fixes #56347.

	* languages.h: Changed the copyright notice to include the GNOME I18N
		mailing list; also re-added examples for the structure fields
		 and integrated all corrections, suggestions, updates for
		  Chinese, Dutch, Maltese and Slovak from others and for
		   Turkish, Hungarian and Korean according to the po files
		    for gtranslator by me.

	* color-schemes.c/.h, gui.c & prefs.c: Renamed the "free_color_scheme_*"
		functions to "gtranslator_color_scheme_free*" -- more logical.

	* actions.c: Renamed the macro from "SWAP_ACTIONS" to
		"gtranslator_actions_swap" to make it's function more clear.

	* prefs.c: Free up the old used "theme" before applying the new
		colorscheme from the preferences box -- should've been a big
		 memory leak as there are *many* informations in "theme".

	* gui.c: Added "delete_text_handler" to catch text deletions -- undo is
		coming nearer -- though a working "kill_word" would've been
		 much nicer for us.

	* main.c: Remove a debug g_print -- the warning message is enough;
		disabled the possibility to define a runtime colorscheme per
		 command line, removed all connected stuff.

	* stylistics.c: Don't be too loud about a non-existing widget -- simply
		return.

2001-06-17  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c & main.c: Call the "gtranslator_set_style" functions on window
		creation and not in the main() function.

	* id.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_id_load/save_list" functions for loading/
		saving a plain string encoded list of GtrIDs -- the maximum
		 length is currently hard coded to 10.

	* sidebar.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_sidebar_show/hide" functions, moved
		private variables to the source file and added the one any only
		 "gtranslator_sidebar_toggle" function for toggling the sidebar
		   -- content changes and menu sensitiveness should also be
		    reviewed later on.

	* prefs.c/.h, stylistics.c: Use the "use_own_colors/fonts" fields instead
		of a single "use_own_specs" field -- fonts and colors are now
		 appliable independently.

	* main.c: Fix a small fallible colorscheme appliance, don't store the
		command-line supplied colorscheme data --  a cmd-line colorscheme
		 should be only applied for the current gtranslator session.

	* stylistics.c: Get the font name from the new locations depending on
		the widget name; "trans_box" stands for our translation area
		 and therefore we'd use the "Translation Font" there -- also
		  corrected a small craziness about applying the fonts also
		   where the user didn't want this.

	* prefs.c/.h: Move some stuff 'round and use the new utility functions
		for adding the color/font pickers to the preferences dialog;
		 use 2 different fonts for the msgid and msgstr parts and also
		  present 2 font pickers to the user -- should be nice for
		   Big5 users of gtranslator -- also show the colorschemes in
		    a GtkComboBox and let the user select the colorscheme from
		     there.

	* utils_gui.c/.h: Added GnomeColorPicker and GnomeFontPicker adding
		convenience functions for the preferences tables.

2001-06-16  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.h, parse_core.c & utf8.c: Honor the new "locale_charset" field
		for the GtrPo structure which holds now the locale charset name
		 name returned by the "gtranslator_utils_get_locale_name"
		  function -- no need to let the function work x times in the
		    sources.

	* open-differently.c: Added "about:" to the URI detection routines --
		hm, finally, the about: URIs should work now.

	* convert.c: Disabled an assertion which made the conversion function
		moan on non-translated msgstrs -- NULL msgstrs are ok, as
		 as untranslated messages are "normal".

	* utf8.c: Corrected a really wrong typo _to_utf8 to _from_utf8 to make
		the function work right and corrected a wrong call of the
		 conversion functions to finally fix the UTF-8 support.

	* parse.c: Honor the new function and set up/clean up the
		"runtime/filename" preferences key used for the instances
		 detection/recognition.

	* utils_gui.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_utils_check_file_being_open"
		function for instances detection to avoid multiple openings
		 of the same po file.

	* translation-memories.c/.h: Swept out the old sources and made
		empty foo sources out of them -- we've got to wait for
		 Semerkent to get this working..

	* id.c/.h: Added copy, addition, removal and search functions
		for the GtrIDs and made the functions be more "normal"
		 and use now mostly "GtrID *id" like arguments, no
		  "address argumentation" more needed -- saving, reading
		    will be done soon.

2001-06-14  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* backend.c: Don't run on NULL backends list -- we won't forget
		the "-n"/"--no-modules" option, right..

2001-06-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* utf8.c: Added some more assertions to avoid crashes in the
		"gtranslator_utf8_po_file_is_utf8" function.

	* utils.c: Include <config.h> only if HAVE_CONFIG_H is defined.

	* actions.c, sidebar.c, undo.c, utf8.c & views.c: Include <config.h>
		if needed; this is a prevention issue currently .-)

2001-06-11  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* header_stuff.c: translate Language field.
	* utils.c: include config.h

2001-06-08  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c & main.c: Also change the calls to be now
		"gtranslator_utils_remove_temp_files" as the function was
		  renamed and "reworked".

	* utils.c/.h: Make the "gtranslator_utils_remove_temp_file" function
		be "gtranslator_utils_remove_temp_files" and clean up the
		 used temporary files eventually lying around in ~/.gtranslator;
		  also added a "gtranslator_utils_get_save_differently_file_name"
		   to get the correcponding filename for the save-diffently.c/h
		    functions.

	* Makefile.am: Added new sources to our sources list and removed the
		undo-core.c/.h source files.
	
	* undo-core.c/.h & undo.h: Removed undo-core sources.

	* open-differently.c/.h: Also moved all "subclass" open calls to the
		source file so that only the general "gtranslator_open_po_file"
		 function is left over in the header.

	* parse.c: Integrate the differently saving routines into the standard
		file saving routine "gtranslator_save_file".

	* save-differently.c/.h: Added differently saving sources/functions;
		quite similar to the differently opening sources.

2001-06-07  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.h, actions.c, header_stuff.c, parse_core.c & message.c: Use
		the "gtranslator_utf8_po_file_is_utf8" function only once at
		 parse time and set the new GtrPo field "utf8"; no need to
		  call the same function >= 7 times in the sources.

	* open-differently.c: Use the new function for checking for the
		needed uncompression programs -- removed the internally used
		 old "check_for_prog" function.

	* utils_gui.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_utils_check_program" function
		for checking if a defined kind of program is in $PATH --
		 gives out a warning if the program is missing.

	* id.c/.h: Small changes and enhancements for the GtrID stuff.

	* stylistics.h: The defines are now correctly named "GTR_STYLISTICS_H"
		and no longer "LIBGTRANSLATOR_STYLISTICS_H".

	* header_stuff.c/.h: Added "generator" field to the GtrHeader structure;
		it's parsed in, but we don't save it/add it to new po files; we
		 just parse it.

	* syntax-elements.h: Added some prefixes to the syntax highlighted
		prefixes list (mostly EMail protocol prefixes like "pop3:").

	* sidebar.c: Don't use a "GetLocalString" macro -- call the function
		named "e_utf8_from_locale_string" -- no need to call up macro.

	* header_stuff.c & message.c: Use the new methods from utf8.c/.h and
		don't use the gal methods -- they're not good for us.

	* utf8.c/.h: New gal-alike convenience function for getting/setting
		GtkEntry/GtkText contents from/to UTF-8.

	* parse.c: Use the new routines to get safe and sane filenames for the
		compile process -- don't save the file unasked and unneededly;
		 also test on every save if the file should be saved under it's
		  original name -- if not, don't disable the save entries.

	* utils.c/.h: New "gtranslator_utils_get_compile_file_names" function
		for getting and assigning the compile file names and the new
		 "gtranslator_utils_remove_compile_files" function for cleaning
		   up and freeing the stuff afterwards.

	* actions.c, gui.c: Remove any old undo code usage.

	* undo-core.c/.h, undo.c/.h: Starting of a redesign of the undo code.

	* learn.c: Fix the empty lines recognition -- should fix the long and
		empty learned-strings files.

	* prefs.c: Use the new utils methods for attaching the spin buttons.

	* utils_gui.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_utils_attach_spin_with_label"
		function for adding/attaching spin buttons easier.

2001-06-06  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* menus.c: Don't include use the xpm icons, we've moved over to png
		icons and they're now installed into $(sharedir)/pixmaps/gtranslator.

	* Makefile.am & pixmaps/*: Removed the pixmaps directory from here.

	* \*.c: Changed all includes accordingly for the outsourcing.

	* Makefile.am: Added utils_gui.c/.h to the sources list.

	* utils.c/.h & utils_gui.c/.h: Outsources GUI related utility functions
		into separate "utils_gui.c/.h" source files.

2001-06-05  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* learn.c: Added new "gtranslator_learn_get_learned_string" function
		for returning the matching string from the learned strings
		 buffer; use internally a GCompletion and do all the init. and
		  shutdown/clean up for all parts.

	* actions.c: Removed the "id==0" case -- I never had this and it
		should never occure.

	* history.c: Respect the new setting from the preferences for the
		maximum recent files count.

	* prefs.c/h, prefs_init.c: Include another option for the maximum
		count of the recent files list -- per default set to 10.

2001-06-03  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c, open-differently.c: Use the new function to determine
		the URI prefixes support state.

	* utils.c/.h: New "gtranslator_utils_uri_supported" function to
		simply determine if the given file_uri includes a supported
		 prefix/URI.

	* message.c: While updating the message contents also learn the
		string by inserting it into the learn buffer.

	* gui.c & main.c: Added learn buffer initialization/shutdown.

	* learn.c: Don't create the "~/.gtranslator" directory -- it's done
		now by the main function; also cleaned up some unneeded stuff
		 and corrected an importanty typo ("gtransator_learn_init");
		  changed the read/write logic to be "normal" file stream
		   operations and set the learned strings limit to 2048.

	* vfs-handle.c: Reduce the includes to include 4 GnomeVFS headers
		instead of all through <libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs.h>; use the
		 e_mkdir_hier function for creating the directories and check
		  some values before operating on them via g_return_val_if_fail.

	* sighandling.c: Save the file directly per "gtransator_save_file" and
		do not call any dialogs.

	* main.c: Initialize GnomeVFS if needed and create ~/.gtranslator per
		"gtranslator_utils_create_gtranslator_directory".

	* utils.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_utils_create_gtranslator_directory"
		function which should create ~/.gtranslator per GnomeVFS;
		 include all the necessary GnomeVFS headers for this.

	* dialogs.c, parse.c, main.c & sighandling.c: Use the new
		"gtranslator_utils_get_crash_file_name" function to get the
		  crash file's filename.

	* dialogs.c, parse.c & utils.c: Use the new temp. file name getting
		"gtranslator_utils_get_temp_file_name" function instead of own
		  g_strdup_printf dump.

	* utils.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_utils_get_temp_file_name" function
		which returns the newly temporary filename, which is now:
		 "~/.gtranslator/gtranslator-temp-po-file"; also added
		  a corresponding "gtranslator_utils_get_crash_file_name"
		   function.

	* parse.c: Reordered includes and use once a nautilus_strcmp instead
		off strcmp.

	* dialogs.c, gui.c & vfs-handle.c: Made the remote->local corresponding
		directory to be "~/.gtranslator/hostname" instead of the old
		 "~/.gtranslator-hostname".

	* header_stuff.c: Check if the regex could be compiled at all before
		acting on it -- if not, try to determine the elements via very
		 strange nautilus_str & g_strreverse games; should fix the
		  strange crash on hu_HU locale.

	* dialogs.c: No need to duplicate the "about:" URI detection in the
		URI dialogs callback and in the "gtranslator_open_po_file"
		 function; removed the dialog callback detection lines and
		  require real prefixes like "http://" instead of just "http:".

2001-06-02  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* open-differently.c: Added "about:" URI support also for the command
		line .-)

	* comment.c/.h: Added "utf8_comment" field and included it in new/
		copy/free methods.

2001-06-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* comment.c/.h: Added convenience "gtranslator_comment_copy"
		function and "gtranslator_comment_append" function for
		 real use in gtranslator later on.

	* learn.c/.h: Extended the learn buffer to be something like a
		completion buffer and to not depend on TM.

2001-05-31  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* comment.c/.h: Added extended comment types recognition/enum values.

	* utf8.c: Made it use the new "gtranslator_convert_" functions
		instead of hard-to-handle and crazy gal sources; also
		 removed any locale-setting/getting calls; needs a
		  review though as it produces sometimes, somehow garbage.

	* utils.c: Use "nautilus_strcasecmp" instead of "g_strcasecmp".

	* Makefile.am: Added convert.c/.h to the build sources.

	* convert.c/.h: Added conversion sources.

	* parse.c: Fix the autosave-checking routines while save-time.

2001-05-30  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* utils.c: Made the "gtranslator_utils_get_locale_name" function
		operate a bit better via using "g_strcasecmp" instead of
		 "strcmp".

	* translation-memories.c/.h: Removed any own cruft; these files
		will handle Semerkent later on.

	* parse.c: Hook up the autosave routine and handle with the source
		tag on file closure; moved the disabling of the ACT_SAVE
		 action into "gtranslator_save_file".

	* prefs_init.c: Added sane autosave values to the preferences
		initializing function.

	* prefs.c: Added option saving/restoring and the autosave corresponding
		widgets/preferences page to the prefs-box.

	* utils.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_utils_autosave" function for handling
		the periodic autosaving future.

	* \*.*: Renamed "wants" to "GtrPreferences" -- wants would be
		too easy to mix up.

	* prefs.h: Added several GtrPreferences parts for autosave option:
		"autosave", "autosave_timeout", "autosave_with_suffix"
		  and "autosave_suffix".

2001-05-30  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* dialogs.c: pressing 'enter' in find entry hits find button.

2001-05-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am, defines.config, main.c: Removed all TM backends
		references.

	* gui.c, sidebar.c: Removed any current gtranslator_undo_add calls.

	* sidebar.c: Re-mark the sidebar strings for translation.

	* gui.c: Also remove the temp. file exit; removed the undo/redo
		debug messages from the code.

	* main.c: Use the new function to clean up the temp file on startup.

	* utils.c/.h: New util function "gtranslator_utils_remove_temp_file"
		which cleans up the gtranslator-generated temp. file in the
		 user's home dir; also include <libgnome/gnome-util.h> for
		  g_file_exists function.

2001-05-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c/.h: Renamed "actual_write" to "gtranslator_save_file" and
		made it be declared publically.

	* menus.c & prefs.c: Use "po file" stringently everywhere instead of
		"po-file" in strings.

	* parse.c/.h: Call up "gtranslator_file_dialogs_store_directory" from
		the "actual_write" function to store the directory name.

	* parse.c/.h & dialogs.c: Renamed "parse_the_file" to the better name
		"gtranslator_parse_the_file_from_file_dialog".

	* dialogs.c/.h: Added gtranslator_file_dialogs_set/store_directory
		for handling the file dialogs completions more convenient.

	* dialogs.c/.h & menus.c: Added import/export dialogs for UTF-8/plain
		text encoding handling.

2001-05-25  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* languages.h: By request of Vasif -- changed to Azerbaijani Turkish
		(from Azeri).

2001-05-24  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* comment.c: Use nautilus_strlen for the string length calculation.

	* backend.c: Changes in the gtranslator_backend_open function to
		operate logically on the backends list, don't use the copies
		 of the filenames/extensions lists and don't copy a NULL list
		  (hehe, damned typos).

	* main.c: Small string changes to be more readable (though it doesn't
		still "look" very good).

2001-05-18  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* dialogs.c: typing a number and pressing enter now really goes to
	desired message. Added stock pixmaps to Go and Find buttons.

	* gui.c: fixed printing of fuzzy and translated counts.

2001-05-15  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* menus.c: Added import, export from/o UTF-8 menu entries and added
		the hotkey for Autoaccomplish: it's 'o'.

	* actions.c: Implemented enabling/disabling of the import, export
		entries.

2001-05-14  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* actions.h: Added ACT_IMPORT_UTF8 and ACT_EXPORT_UTF8 enum values.

	* utils.c: Use nautilus_strcasecmp instead of g_strcasecmp in one
		place.

	* backend.c: Operate on local copies and not on the lists themselves
		and free the local copies after our operations.

	* header_stuff.c: Also tactile with UTF-8 based translator names and
		comments.

	* query.c, utils.c/.h: Moved the setup_language routine to utils.c/.h,
		renamed it to gtranslator_utils_get_full_language_name and
		 changed some parts of it to use a GString to be more robust.

	* message.c: Added UTF-8 support, displaying, editing and saving is
		working now.

	* utf8.c: Made the environment rescueing/restoring/setting go through
		functions; also added functions for use within gtranslator to
		 handle UTF-8 support (gal isn't clever enough for us .-).

2001-05-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Changed the TM backends location to be
		$(libdir)/gtranslator/translation-memories.

	* open-differently.c: Added the gtranslator_backend_open function to
		the list of "special" file opening functions.

	* backend.c/.h: Set the "modulename" field to the full filename for the
		backend and make the modulename be non-const; implemented all
		 of the module loading -- backends core is ready now.

2001-05-12  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* backend.c: Implemented the informations getting routine for the
		backends.

	* query.c & backend.c: Changed the calls of the
		gtranslator_utils_file_names_from_directory function to please
		 the new format.

	* utils.c/.h: Changed the gtranslator_utils_file_names_from_directory
		funtion to also take a "with_full_path" argument and to take
		 care of prepending the full path if the argument if TRUE --
		  also corrected a stupid typo g_list_append instead of
		   g_list_sort -- vim's autocompletion is sometimes making
		    hell .-)

2001-05-10  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* Makefile.am: backends should be compiled before .

	* gui.c/h, parse.c/h: made global variables extern.

	* header_stuff.c (substitute): it is OK to get NULL *item. Just set
	good value.

	* utils.c/h (gtranslator_utils_getline): new function to read a line
	from file.

	* parse.c (gtranslator_parse_core): removed line length limit, use above
	function for reading lines from file.

	* utf8.c (convert_all_messages): removed. g_list_foreach does the same!

2001-05-10  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* utf8.c: Made the environment/language set/get-ting routines work
		more intelligently and made the processes not start
		 independently whether we're successful or not.

	* Makefile.am: Corrected a stupid error in the "defines.include" rule:
		of course the backends directory is in $(libdir)/gtranslator.

	* main.c: Added the "--no-modules/-n" option for inhibiting any module
		usage -- also added bits of backends stuff.

	* utils.c: Use the nautilus_strcmp function for sorting the file list.

	* learn.c: Use the new GtrID routines to get a TM id.

	* id.c/.h: New "gtranslator_id_new_id_string" function for encapsulating
		the GtrID->string conversion in the learn code.

2001-05-06  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>
	
	* utf8.c & utils.c: Don't free the "old_env" variables and take
		over the convert_all_messages function from utils.c.

	* main.c: Also show up the build versions of Glib/Gtk+/Gnome libs
		and make it easier for translators by separating the formats
		 and the plain text fragments.

	* Makefile.am, defines.config: Added Glib/Gtk+/Gnome libs building/
		compiling versions to the defines.

	* about.c/.h & \*.*: Small re-rename to gtranslator_about_dialog.

	* dialogs.c: Also use the nautilus-string functions here; added
		about: URI support .-)

	* open-differently.c, vfs-handle.c/.h: Arg, made the function again
		be named logically "gtranslator_vfs_handle_open", was a rename
		 error; also use nautilus_str_has_prefix in prefix getting
		  functions.

	* Makefile.am: Added the id.c/.h sources.

	* id.c/.h: Added new GtrID sources, almost everything is already
		implemented there.

	* translation-memory.h: Removed the GtrID stuff from here.

2001-05-05  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c/utils.c: Use nautilus_istr_has_suffix instead of
		nautilus_str_has_suffix -- ergo, ignore the case.

	* Makefile.am: Added comment.c/.h to the sources.

	* comment.c/.h: Added sources for "enhanced" comments handling --
		including an own "GtrComment" structure.

	* views.h: Corrected a small typo.

2001-05-04  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* translation-memory.c/h: More ideas/skeleton implementations.

	* Makefile.am: Added utf8.c/.h to the sources.

	* utils.c/.h & utf8.c/.h: Outsourced the UTF-8 functions to separate
		files and renamed them to "gtranslator_utf8_*".

2001-05-04  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gui.c (selection_get_handler): new function. Changes dots back to
	spaces when pasting anywwhere.
	
	* backend.c, history.c, message.c, prefs_init.c, sighandling.c:
	fix warnings.
	
	* translation-memory.c (gtranslator_tm_add): add fake definition.

2001-05-04  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* learn.c: Use the translation-memory functions to perform "learning".

	* translation-memory.h: First structures/implementation ideas.

2001-05-03  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Made a comment more verbose; flushing fs doesn't help
		either -- the g_free's had to rest uncommented.

	* utils.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_utils_get_locale_name/_charset"
		functions to get the language code/charset for the language
		 of the header; added from/to UTF-8 converting functions.

2001-05-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* backends.c/.h: More implementation done.

	* query.c: Changed accordingly for the new structure of the
		"gtranslator_utils_file_names_from_directory" function.

		"gtranslator_utils_file_names_from_directory" a bit.

2001-04-30  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Made the defines.include file react on source changes.

	* gui.c: Added first undo/redo stuff to here.
	
	* undo.c: Removed the nested undo/redo calls for every redo/undo step.

2001-04-29  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Fixed #53829 (crash on editing of dpkg's de.po): added
		a sanity check while writing -- fixes the crash.

	* actions.c, gui.c & sidebar.c: Added first undo/redo steps in code.

	* actions.c/.h: Added ACT_REDO, it's foo'sh skeleton function and
		made ACT_UNDO and ACT_REDO react sensitive on our actions.

	* menus.c: Adding Redo/Undo entries for the toolbar/menus.

2001-04-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Added a -b/--build-informations option to get a view on
		all the build informations.

	* defines.config: Small changes in the define names.

	* Makefile.am: Improved comment a small bit.

	* backend.c/.h: More cleanup, starting implementation; switching
		over to extension based backend use -- no mime types anymore.

	* query.c: Use the new util-function instead of the own parsing of
		the localedirectory.

	* utils.c/.h: Added a function to return an appropiate list of
		filenames matching a given extension -- and if wanted:
		 also a sorted list of filenames; another function peforms
		  stringlist_strcasecmp actions .-)

2001-04-27  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: Corrected a malformed prefs location and added also
		storage of the last queried filename itself.

	* syntax-elements: Added more syntax highlighted words.

	* backend.h: Added all the prototypes -- will be implemented soon.

	* .cvsignore: Ignore the generated defines.include file.

	* main.c, prefs.c & update.c: Include the produces "defines.include"
		file for the includes.

	* defines.config & Makefile.am: Added Makefile.am stuff around
		this file which holds now the overlong defines -- better
		 then defining them directly via -D... -- removed these
		  direct command line defines and added dist/clean commands
		   for the defines.include/config files.

2001-04-24  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added new source files to the build and added
		BACKENDS_TMDIR define.

	* backend.c/.h, learn.c/.h & translation-memory.c/.h: New source
		files for backends handling, learning and translation
		 memory support.

2001-04-21  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Corrected a small thinking error, substitute the
		right value ("mime" instead of "lc").

	* main.c: Don't include <popt-gnome.h>, it's not needed and added
		another option to define another localesdir where to search
		 for query domains.

2001-04-19  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Mark the argument explanation names for translation.

	* parse_core.c: Include "utils.h" for the moved
		"gtranslator_utils_check_file_permissions" function.

	* parse.c/h & utils.c/.h: Moved "gtranslator_check_file_perms"
		to "gtranslator_utils_check_file_permissions"; include
		 "dialogs.h" in "utils.c".

	* gtkspell.c: Removed the FIXME in front of the color assignments
		-- it's the way  gtranslator handles the colors and this is
		 definitely Ok.

2001-04-19  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* dialogs.* (gtranslator_error): new function. Use it everywhere.
	
	* gui.h (status): removed this global variable.

	* parse.c (add_to_obsolete): new function.
	(gtranslator_parse_core): don't check for file perms. open read-only.
	Use add_to_obsolete() to add one obsolete entry when appriopriate. So
	obsolete messages can be mixed with normal ones.
	
	Use nautilus-string functions to make code a bit cleaner, update to
	error and status changes above.

	* menus*: move everything into menus.c, leave only menus.h which
	contains only extern declarations. header files should not have any
	variables, because this can cause problems.

	* Makefile.am, actions.c. gui.c, message.c, session.c:
	update to above changes.

2001-04-14  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Fixed a crash cause in case of fallible header
		fields -- check the strings for substitution on emptyness
		 before doing anything.

2001-04-10  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* open-differently.c/.h: Added opening function for zip'ed po
		files and made the extension "parser" use the nautilus-string
		 methods; also check for the used uncompression programs
		  before using them simply and use eventually a warning dialog
		   to inform the user.

2001-04-09  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added BACKENDSDIR define to the CFLAGS.

	* header_stuff.c: Applied a patch from Maxim Sobolev
		<sobomax@FreeBSD.org> to avoid a crash when no language
		 is set in the preferences; also fixed two stupid errors in
		  the other code.

2001-04-08  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* backends/*: Added backends files and Makefile/CVS stuff around it
		-- these backend files aren't finished ever, they've just
		 got started.

	* Makefile.am: Added "backends" to the SUBDIRS.

	* about.c: Added some more informational widget into the about box;
		now there is the current colorscheme displayed with version,
		 author and author email via a GnomeHREF widget, so that you
		  can directly contact the current colorscheme's author.

	* Makefile.am: Include the new menu files.

	* menus_main.h, menus_message_status.h & menus_misc.h: Put the
		corresponding parts of the menus into these new files.

	* menus.h: Outsourced some menu parts to gain -Werror enabled build.

	* htmlizer.c: Also print out a small footprint about gtranslator.

	* prefs.h, prefs_init.c & utils.c/.h: Moved the old -> new color
		location converting function to the util. functions and
		 named it "gtranslator_utils_old_colors_to_new_location".

	* languages.h: Cosmetic rename "lang" -> "GtrLanguage" and indent
		changes; I love vim ,-)

	* header_stuff.c: Changed the includes to also include "utils.h"
		for the GUI util. functions.

	* prefs.c/.h & utils.c/.h: Moved the attach_* functions to
		gtranslator_utils_attach_* and the gtranslator_create/free_lists
		 functions to gtranslator_utils_language_lists_create/free
		  and outsourced them into utils.c/.h.

2001-04-07  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* utils.c/.h & prefs.c/.h: Moved the gtranslator_geometry_save/restore
		functions to gtranslator_utils_geometry_save/restore.

	* *.c: Fully corrected includes and reodered all includes to be
		alphabetical.
	
	* actions.c/.h & gui.c: As we can't directly operate on the
		acts[] array anymore use the new utility
		 "gtranslator_actions_disable_fuzzy_menu_item" function.

	* *.c/.h: Include the new headers where needed and
		reorder almost all includes to be alphabetically -- currently
		 it doesn't build with -Werror enabled.

	* Makefile.am: Include the new source files.

	* actions.c/.h, message.c/.h & utils.c/.h: Outsourced
		common stuff from *.* to these new files -- the
		 consequence of the renaming.

2001-04-06  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added new sources to the build.

	* undo-core.c/.h & undo.c/.h: Added new Undo sources -- needs much
		working left over.

	* dialogs.c: Corrected the ifdef pair to be "GTR_DIALOGS_H".

	* *.*: Tons of renaming -- almost all function names are changed
		and more valuable for a future outsourcing.
	
	* gui.c/.h: Renamed some variables:
	
		app1 	-> gtranslator_application,
		appbar1	-> gtranslator_application_bar,
		text1 	-> text_box.

	* sidebar.c: Changed the "application-x-gmo.png" references to be now
		"application-x-po.png".
	
	* views.c: Added Gediminas to the author(s) of this file.

2001-04-05  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* dialogs.c: use raise_and_return_if_exists() for dialogs which should
	be unique. Use stock buttons for cancel/close.
	(open_uri_dialog): set default button to Open and pressing Enter in
	entry presses that button.
	* gui.c: include fixes related to CVS gal cleanup. Move Views menu after
	Edit and rename to View -- as sugegstions.txt says.
	(create_app1): disable actions because no files is opened. Moved
	set_style to prefs.c.
	(display_msg, goto_given_msg): fail if message == NULL, not crash.
	* gui.h: made update_appbar public.
	* header_stuff.c (get_header): better detect non-existing header.
	(gtranslator_header_fill_up): return if anything has beend changed or
	not.
	(create_header_from_prefs): new function.
	* header_stuff.h: reflect above changes.
	* parse.c: fix includes.
	(parse): Check for file existance before calling parse_core.
	removed "Successfully parsed" status message -- it is obvious :)
	Do not set winow title to temporary name. If header does not exist --
	create one! Always fill missing values in header. Cleanup disable stuff.
	(close_file): set default window title.
	(compile): compile real file, not a copy.

2001-04-04  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Corrected a define bug -- it's WINDOW_ICON for which we
		should check -- brings back the window-icon.

	* parse.c: Removed a FIXME -- it works perfectly already with gchar's.

	* update.c: Changed the update command call accordingly to the new
		my-update.sh syntax -- should be much less errorful.

	* syntax.c, syntax-elements.h & Makefile.am: Outsourced syntax
		patterns into the new "syntax-elements.h" file and added
		 it to the sources.

2001-04-03  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* syntax.c: Added more words to the syntax highlighted words'
		list.

	* views.c: Check the range always before setting the position.

	* dialogs.c & replace.c: Only allow replaces in translation and
		comment fields -- also free up the 2 used gchars.

2001-04-02  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Reverted my change from yesterday dealing with 'Â·' insertions,
		they're now again inverted.

2001-04-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* replace.c: Redisplay the current message to show replaces in the
		current message immediately.

	* gui.c: Count the syntax updates we do perform -- avoid updating
		the syntax 3x or twice just because of a change and the
		 syntax functions -- should be less flickering now; also
		  don't invert the 'Â·' character (or it's translated
		   equivalent) while inserting.

2001-03-31  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Also connect the SIGSEGV signal to the own
		"gtranslator_signal_handler" signal handling function
		  and free the "sp_file" variable meanwhile (+184).

	* syntax.c: Added some more keywords and prefixes to highlight.

2001-03-30  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Fixed the overwriting bug with a selection pos
		saving/restoring step before/after the syntax update.

	* sidebar.c: Added Gediminas to the authors.

2001-03-29  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	Hopefully fixed all crashes and position problems.
	
	* gui.c: use update_msg() instead of removed
	views_prepare_for_navigation().
	(paste_clipboard): do not call syntax_update.
	(text_has_got_changed): same.
	* sidebar.c: (select_icon): do not switch {}, simply jump to item
	number.
	* syntax.c: (syntax_update_text): set position only after thaw. This
	was the cause of crash.
	* views.c: (gtranslator_views_set): changed view check to
	g_return_if_fail to see warnings. Do not change views if not needed.
	Call update_msg before leaving message view. Set editable flag in
	this function, also change nothing_changes.
	(gtranslator_views_prepare_for_navigation): removed.
	* views.h: sort enum by view order, not alphabet :)

2001-03-29  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* Makefile.am: GCONF_IS_PRESENT is added to GCONF_CFLAGS in configure
	now. Always define WINDOW_ICON.
	* main.c: revert back to checking USE_WINDOW_ICON.
	use GNOMELOCALEDIR instead of additional variable.
	* dialog.c: no need to include gnome-window-icon anymore.

2001-03-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* views.c: Rewrite the C format routines according to the "new"
		syntax highlight code for C formats.

	* syntax.c & views.c: Put the gtk_editable_get/set_position to their
		right positions -- corrects the view changing bug.

	* header_stuff.c: Corrected the year getting/substituting and
		also update the comment if the user changed the package
		 name; check if there's a language set in the prefs ever
		  before using it in the comment -- otherwise use a non-
		   specific comment.

	* syntax.c: Added Gediminas as an author, fixed C format error which
		got into the sources; made the used special character appear
		 translated or pure -- depending on the user preference --
		  and did extend the C format recognizing a bit.

2001-03-28  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gui.c: (insert_text_handler): new function. Moved simplified dot char
	conversion here from text_has_got_changed. So one position set-get pair
	not needed and works faster as it analyses only inserted text.
	Pass view type to switch_view and do not switch {}.
	* header_stuff.c: (language_in_english): new function.
	(substitute), (replace_substring): new simple functions.
	(gtranslator_header_fill_up): simplify. Do not query config, use
	variables from prefs.h. Substitute values only if they are standard
	ones. Fix lots of memleaks.
	* main.c: wrap set_style with config_init/close.
	* parse_core.c: replaced translated warnings with g_return_if_fail.
	Take fuzzy status off the first message, if it is the header.
	* syntax.c: (gtranslator_syntax_insert_text): initialize variables.
	Move clear_string from every case to the top. Removed set_position from
	this func.
	(gtranslator_syntax_update_text): use simple char * instead of GString.

2001-03-25  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* about.c: Removed Thomas from the authors' list.

2001-03-23  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: If the user didn't enter any string to query for,
		present him/her an warning dialog (the conditional is
		 right now), store the last query change in the prefs
		  and do only use GtrQuery's as the GtrQueryResult stuff
		   got removed now.
	
	* query.c/.h: Removed GtrQueryResult's and made all functions work
		with GtrQuery's -- the results are also queries now.

	* Makefile.am & main.c: We don't need to also define
		"USE_WINDOW_ICON" as we can also use the "WINDOW_ICON"
		  directive to determine if we can use the window-icon
		   feature of gnome-libs; removed "USE_WINDOW_ICON" define
		    from the CFLAGS.

2001-03-22  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_header_fill_up" function
		which inserts/fills up all informations needed for the
		 header and the ehader comment from the preferences and
		  substitutes the "variables" from the default header comment
		   like "YEAR" etc.

	* parse.c: Use the new function to fill up the header if possible.

2001-03-21  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* sidebar.c: Get the localized names for the icon entries and
		the sidebar title, also perform a UTF-8'ification of the
		 localized title/entries so that this problem should be
		  solved now.

	* sidebar.c & gui.c: Switched over to small sidebar icons and
		enlarged the default pane position to 85.

	* sidebar.c: Added hotkey view icon, callbacks and integrated
		it into the "framework"; the "new" icons should be now
		 easily integrable into the switch for the internally
		  used "URI" types "comment:", "hotkey:" etc.

	* gui.c: Added hotkey view to the views menu and to the
		"switch_view" function, added ACT_VIEW_HOTKEY enum value
		  and added it to the standard switches for the menus.

	* views.h: Added an explanatory comment.

	* views.c: Included <ctype.h> and reworked the number and
		C format views to work; use new helper functions for
		 the named view types and easify work with the new
		  "insert_space" and "setup_text" functions -- also
		    added hotkey view to our circles.

2001-03-20  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added nautilus-string.c/.h to the sources.

	* nautilus-string.c/.h: Copied over from the nautilus sources --
		a good piece of useful code.

	* replace.c: Use the "new" nautilus-string sources and functions
		and activate the changed and save routines -- it works
		 now as wished.

	* htmlizer.c: Set the document title to a more comprehensive
		"PROJECT -- VERSION" form.

2001-03-18  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* replace.c: Use pos[f] for the position replacements -- avoids an
		endless loop but it doesn't still work.

	* gui.c & syntax.c: Small shuffle for the gtk_text_thaw calls.

	* views.c: Made the routines all respect the "special char"
		selection of the user.

	* syntax.c: Set "aInserted" to FALSE in the loops, corrects
		the stupid errors introduced with the keywords table
		 based highlight method; also added some more keywords
		  and URI prefixes to the tables.

	* color-schemes.c/.h: Removed the list getting function.

	* views.c/.h: Added "gtranslator_views_prepare_for_navigation"
		function for preparation of navigation, added 2 get
		 methods for the internal used view name variables
		  and also added a number view; made the number and C
		   format view use regex.

	* gui.c/.h: Added ACT_VIEW_NUMBER action and menu item, also
		made the "goto_given_msg" function use the new
		 "gtranslator_views_prepare_for_navigation" from
		   views.c/.h; also chanegd the paned position from 75
		    to 80.

	* sidebar.c: Added number view "icon" and integrated it into the
		creation/deletion methods of the sidebar.

2001-03-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c/.h: Added views menu from which you can now also switch
		the views of the current message; also added all the
		 backend work in ACT_VIEW_* "classes".

	* Makefile.am: Added views.c/.h to the sources.

	* find.c & sidebar.c: Switched over to the new sources view
		via "gtranslator_views_set" and the GTR_COMMENT_VIEW
		 argument and removed some old cruft which was used
		  here to rescue position+contents -- this is now already
		   done by the views methods.

	* sidebar.c/.h: Removed "show_comment" function from here and added
		3rd icon for the new C format view.

	* views.c/.h: General views structure and functions are here; added
		a C format view.

2001-03-16  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* syntax.c: Added a new and quite useful "back_match" function
		and corresponding macro to make the keyword and URL matching
		 readable -- it's now quite easy to do and working; also
		  removed the "eq" and "beq" macros.

	* header_stuff.c, prefs.c: Messages politure.

	* dialogs.c: Give the current message position to the used
		"gtranslator_replace_new" call.

	* replace.c/.h: Added a "start_offset" field for the GtrReplace
		structure -- needed for the replace single task which
		 should now also be more ready; regex based replace is
		  on the way.
	
2001-03-15  Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* header-stuff.c, prefs.c: changed " :" to ":" a English
	  doesn't use a space before the colon
	* gui.c: added a comment to explain the meaning of the middle
	  dot.

2001-03-15  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* sidebar.c: Show the comment without any syntax highlighting.

	* replace.c: More output -- still not written yet.

	* syntax.c: Also highlight the special character 'Â·' (not
		possible with the gettexted translations as it seems for
		 now to me).

	* parse.c: Check the string before calling strstr on it -- avoids
		a crash -- and made the default header comment look nicer.

2001-03-14  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Disable the "Save" entries if the file is opened from the
		command line (as the file is just being opened there can't be
		 any changes which could be saved).

	* parse.c: Also keep the obsolete messages in right and nice form
		with newlines between the messages -- more readability of
		 the po files and also free up the new "obsolete" field of
		  the GtrPo structure in "free_po".

	* dialogs.c: Hm, keep up the Replace button as we do now again
		support a single replace.

	* replace.c/.h: Restore the old method types and functions and
		made the routines sensitive for the "replace_all" field
		 of a GtrReplace -- a single replace is now also possible;
		  the methods are written now.

2001-03-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* replace.c/.h: Removed the "replace_all" field and the
		corresponding argument to the "gtranslator_replace_new"
		 function; made some more parts for the replace function.

	* dialogs.c: Only allow general full replacement in all messages
		-- no single replace available for now; also removed the
		 possibility to change stuff in the comments. Replace should
		  only work on msgid and msgstr parts.

		Also removed the option to replace case (in-)sensitive;
		 replaces should always be case sensitive.

	* prefs.h: Do not have a "noreplace" field.

2001-03-12  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* .cvsignore: Added po and pot files to the ignores.

2001-03-11  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.h: Added "noreplace" field -- possible useful in the
		future.

	* Makefile.am: Added new replace.c/.h sources.

	* replace.c/.h: Added GtrReplace and co. stuff -- very preliminary
		and not written yet.

	* dialogs.c/.h: Added Replace dialog, callbacks and integration
		with replace.c/.h.

	* gui.c/.h: Added Replace menu/toolbar items and actions.

2001-03-10  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* syntax.c: Also highlight some keywords; the keywords are for now:
		CVS, FIXME, GNU, GNOME, GPL and KDE.

2001-03-09  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* find.c: Made one comment be a C comment, not a C++ comment.

	* stylistics.c: Parse all informations from the color schemes into the
		colors.

	* syntax.c: Use a macro for the char-conditions ("eq(1, 'M')" is nicer
		then "msg[cp+1] && msg[cp+1]=='M'").

	* prefs_init.c: Turn off keeping of obsolete messages per default.

2001-03-08  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* test.po & .cvsignore: Ignore the test po file .-)

	* query.c: Free up the used gchar's in "gtranslator_query_simple" --
		also update the GUI when a string was inserted -- activate Save
		 menu entry/toolbar item and setup the "file_changed" flag for
		  the po file; also corrected setlocale calls to not mix up
		   the language environment of the user.

	* sidebar.c: When the comment "view" is selected only view the
		comment and not the #'s -- call "prepare_comment_for_view"
		 for this.

	* parse.c: Also keep the obsolete messages if wished -- the formatting
		is somehow bad but it works.

2001-03-07  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: Made the dialog a bit nicer and added labels in front of
		the entries.

	* parse.c/.h: Moved the old "get_translated_count" function's own
		declaeation to the header and renamed it to for cleanse to
		 "gtranslator_get_translated_count"; also renamed the
		  "update_msg" function to "gtranslator_update_msg"; maybe
		    a complete namespace cleaning action should be really
		     performed soon.

	* query.c/.h: Added a new "gtranslator_new_query_result" function
		which does what the function's name is like .-) -- use this
		 new function and also use "g_new0" instead of simple "g_new".
	
		Call up and renew the translation count after the internal auto
		 accomplishment and update the progress bar/status message
		  according to the new status bit.

	* header_stuff.c: Check the given comment variable before splitting it
		up for view/save and return an empty default comment to make the
		 po file syntactically right -- avoids another nasty crash.

	* prefs_init.c: Commentix.

2001-03-06  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Arg, keybindings: Reassigned Ctrl+Up for back and Ctrl+Down
		for next -- hopefully this will be the last fix for the
		 keybindings.

	* query.c, dialogs.c & syntax.c: Do not free up the segments of our
		GStrings.

	* dialogs.c: Call the "text_has_got_changed" function if we could
		insert a text into the translation box and do also call only
		 the new wrapper function "gtranslator_query_accomplish".

	* query.c/.h: Renamed "gtranslator_query_all" to be more logical:
		"gtranslator_query_gtr_msg" is the new function name and
		  implemented a toplevel wrapper function named
		   "gtranslator_query_accomplish" which performs the
		     complete accomplishment actions for every empty msgstr.

	* gui.c/.h: Move the "text_has_got_changed" declaration to the header
		and made the function non-static.

2001-03-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c/.h: Added "accomplish_dialog" which asks if gtranslator
		should accomplish missing translations from the default domain
		 and does this with the help of the new function from query.c.

	* gui.c/.h: Added accomplishment menu entry and integrated it into the
		existing actions model -- also changed the keybindings to now:
		 Ctrl+Left  or Ctrl+Down -> Back
		 Ctrl+Right or Ctrl+Up   -> Next
		 Ctrl+Page Up            -> First
		 Ctrl+Page Down          -> Last

	* query.c/.h: Added the new "gtranslator_query_all" function which will
		be useful for the autoinsertion of found translations in the
		 default domain for a msgid (only applied if the msgstr is empty
		  of course).

	* prefs.c/.h: Added a combo box for setting up the default domain and
		added a corresponding structure entry in wants.

	* dialogs.c: Fixed the 2 FIXME's, put the gtranslator_free_query call to
		the right place, manually free'd the GtrQueryResult and also made
		 the dialog set up the stored default query domain at startup.

2001-03-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* sidebar.c: Cosmetical change -- the define is now named GTR_SIDEBAR_H
		and not any longer GTR_SHORTCUT_BAR_H .-)

	* dialogs.c: Added successor dialog after the query has succeeded
		-- it's now possible to let it be pasted into the translation
		 and check if the string to paste into the translation is
		  already there -- why insert e.g. "Open" 12x into the
		   translation box?

	* main.c: Set up the domains list at startup.

	* gui.c: Use the "free_color_scheme" function to free up the used
		color scheme at quit time, added ACT_QUERY and related stuff
		 and renamed the_searchbar to the_navibar.

	* color-schemes.c/.h: Declare "free_color_scheme" in the header to
		make it generally available.

	* gtkspell.c: Don't free up the pointed GdkColor from the color
		scheme.

	* prefs.c, prefs.h & prefs_init.c: Added a toggle option for
		keeping the obsolete messages and also changed the prefs_init
		 function for this.

	* dialogs.c & query.c: Use the new free'ing functions for the own
		GtrQuery(Result) structures; added gtranslator_new_query
		 function for creating a GtrQuery and made the setlocale
		  call reasonable and working (only rescue LC_MESSAGES and
		   reset it).

	* dialogs.c/.h: Added a query dialog which does even work now and
		free the variables a little bit up.

	* query.c: Corrected stupid error, do use strcmp for sorting the
		domains list and don't simply check it via !=; use strcmp
		 for this -- why would've strcmp be invented in C if it would
		  be as easy as in C++ via str!=query->message...
	
		Rescue and reset up the current locale settings after the
		 query, added free'ing functions for the structures aka.
		  "gtranslator_free_query(_result)".

	* syntax.c: Do also insert syntax highlighted text if only one char
		is left over.
	
	* stylistics.c: Take the right locations for the GnomeColorPicker
		values always -- convert depending if we can get values from
		 the new location.

2001-03-04  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* color-schemes.c, query.c, stylistics.c: fixed some warnings... but
	first two files are something insane.

2001-03-03  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Fixed bug in mark_msg_sticky which caused complete hang of
		gtranslator

2001-03-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c & main.c: Added crash recovery dialog which recovers the
		state when the crash-recovery file was created if wished or
		 deletes the recovery file.

	* sighandling.c: Save the po file to a special filename before going
		to the everglades -- the special filename is for now
		 ~/.crash-gtranslator.po -- a dialog around this will be added
		   quite soon.

	* gtkspell.c, color-schemes.c/.h, stylistics.c/.h: Made the gtkspell
		widget use the color scheme address/spell check error colors,
		 added a COLOR_SPELL_ERROR enumeration item and integrated it
		  into the parse/apply processes.

	* query.c/.h: Added a list capable query function, a domains parsing
		function and an utility function "gtranslator_strip_out" which
		 gives you a "pure" and clean name back from a given filename.
	
	* stylistics.c: Hm, don't free up the now simply given color value
		paths and call the new convert fucntion while getting value
		 from the preferences.

	* prefs.h & prefs_init.c: Changed the initial color values according to
		the new color value path and also implemented a new temporary
		 "prefs_convert_colors" function which converts the previous
		   fg/bg values to the moved places.

	* gui.c & stylistics.c: Split up the color setting locations to "fg/bg"
		for color schemes and "own_fg/own_bg" for the GnomeColorPickers
		 to avoid very nice and immenant black color values.

	* gui.c: Insert a separator between the toolbar icons/menu items
		for navigating to first/back and next/last message and also
		 implemented an own keyhandler which now receives the Ctrl+
		  Left/Right and Ctrl+Up/Down keys which are the new keyboard
		   shortcuts for the navigation.
	
	* prefs.c: Added scheme definition GnomeFileEntry and the stuff around
		in the preferences box and entries; reinit the colors after
		 a color scheme change on the fly.

2001-03-02  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Hmm, check status before freeing it -- it could also not be
		used by the update_appbar function, so that we free up a
		 not used gchar -- another crash less.

	* color-schemes.c: Only add the GtrColorSchemeInformations structure
		if the structure is complete and non-NULL and sort the list
		 via strcmp before returning it - hmm, leak hunting: changed
		  much stuff to NOT cause memleaks.

	* prefs_init.c: Arg, blue is nicer then navy for hotkeys, reverted my
		change from yesterday.

	* main.c: If a color scheme/theme is given on the comman line take it
		as our syntax color scheme -- at least we do try it .-)

	* stylistics.c: Use the new color scheme based color selection.

	* color-schemes.c/.h: Implemented the new
		"gtranslator_color_scheme_load_from_prefs" function which
		  restores the stored GtrColorScheme from the preferences
		   "back" as the current theme; also allow spaces around the
		     color names in the color schemes as we do now strip out
		      the spaces.

	* sidebar.c: Check if there's any msgstr data before using strcmp
		-- avoids a nasty crash.

2001-03-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* sighandling.c: Initialize the gint outside the signal handler.

	* color-schemes.c/.h: Added own free_color_scheme(_info) functions
		which do free the used structures and implemented all
		 functions for now.

	* Makefile.am: Define SCHEMESDIR on compiletime to be
		$(datadir)/gtranslator/colorschemes.

	* stylistics.c/.h: Extended the copyright header line and
		renamed the VALUE_DOT_CHAR etc. all to VALUE_SPECIAL_CHAR
		 like in the preferences.

	* color-schemes.c: Got it working and parsing the given
		color schemes -- also check the given file if it's a gtranslator
		 color scheme at all.

	* prefs.h & prefs_init.c: Set up default syntax colors via the new
		prefs_init_syntax_colors function and also declare this
		 new function in the header.

	* query.c: Fiddling around in language names & co.

	* parse.c, parse.h & parse_core.c: Outsourced the real parse routine
		into parse_core.c and named it parse_core -- this makes the
		 nautilus-gtranslator-view work again.

	* htmlizer.c: Also recognize newlines and convert them to <br>
		tags.

	* query.c/.h: Extended the function to take also a language
		parameter.

2001-02-28  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* color-schemes.c/h & sighandling.c/h: Corrected header copyright
		email address of mine.

	* query.c/.h: Added new query sources -- quite simple for now.

	* sighandling.c: Wrote a command line based part which will ask the
		the user now on the command line if we've got to save the file
		 and to do the save task before exiting.

	* Makefile.am: Include the new signal handling and query sources.

	* main.c: Bind the main signals to the new sources.

	* sighandling.c/h: Added preliminary signal handling sources
		which do only print out some messages .-)

	* open-differently.c: Added a comment to clarify the printf
		statement for the translators.

2001-02-27  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Added scheme option to define a color scheme at startup.

	* Makefile.am: Added the new files to the sources.

	* color-schemes.c/.h: Added these color scheme source files.

	* header_stuff.c/.h: Moved the prototype declarations for
		prepare_comment_for_view/save into the header.
	
2001-02-26  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gnome-regex.c & parse.c: Include config.h only if HAVE_CONFIG_H
		is defined.

2001-02-25  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* *.[ch]: #include shuffle to include only what's really needed.
	* gui.c: fix warning with translation of dot char.
	* open-differently.c, parse.c, sidebar.c: fix that stupid thing
	-- *never* initialize char * variables!
	* parse.h: remove percentage, and condition about regex, and
	get_translated_count.
	* pref*, stylistics*, syntax*:: save colors as "#00AA88" instead of
	three values. Use gdk_color_parse and color names. I have had the same
	as gtranslator_syntax_get_section_name, but in stylistics.c and with
	name get_path_from_type... left this one. Use array of GdkColors, not
	allocate them every time. In syntax use COLOR_ enums, not direct
	colors. and s/COLOR_VALUE_/COLOR_/ ...

2001-02-25  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* stylistics.c: Use the new function to determine the section names
		and prepare the customization of the highlight colors.

	* syntax.c/.h: Added a "gtranslator_syntax_get_section_name" function
		which returns the section name for the given ColorValueType.
	
	* dialogs.c: Removed the window-icon setting function really now.

2001-02-24  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Call the window icon setting function at the _right_ time
		just after having called gnome_init_with_popt_table.

	* Makefile.am: Properly define the USE_WINDOW_ICON define and flags
		to get the global window-icon set up.

	* prefs.c: Show up font informations on the preferences page rather
		then simply showing the font button.

	* stylistics.c: Removed the COLOR_VALUE_END_CHAR parts of the switch
		tree as it isn't used anymore/will not be used in the future.

	* stylistics.h: Added the new types which are also used as "classes"
		in the syntax highlighting code to easify the later
		 customization of the syntax highlight colors and removed the
		  COLOR_VALUE_END_CHAR enum item as it'll never be used
		   (gtranslator automatically makes the end chars correctly).

	* parse.c: Check if there's any header before using any simple header
		comment while saving specially opened gettext po file; also
		 count the sticky messages as translated messages and renew the
		  status counts to avoid mess in the status -- a FIXME less.

	* gui.c: Changed the keybindings a bit; the header edit dialog is
		 also available via a F8 now and the message stati are also
		  toggleable via Alt+1/2/3 for Translated/Fuzzy/Stick.
	
		 Also removed an commented statement which would be useless
		  if it would be used -- why leave it there...

	* dialogs.c & main.c: Set the default window icon from the main loop
		and don't do this again and again -- simply use a call of
		 gnome_window_icon_set_default_from_file.

	* open-differently.c/.h: Added functions for opening up bzip2'ed
		and compress'ed gettext po files and made the functions
		 known to the "detection" function "gtranslator_open_po_file".

	* dialogs.c & open-differently.c: Also recognize "hidden" ftp
		and https URI's.

2001-02-24  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* find.c: now find find's all occurences of a string in a message.
		Bug #51189

2001-02-23  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* .cvsignore: Added some newly files to the cvsignores (these
		are to be honest files related to build up a semi-static
		 gtranslator which does only need gnome-libs and gnome-print
		  and no gal etc. anymore).

	* dialogs.c: Initialize findMenu with 0 to avoid an error.

	* preferences.c/h, stylistics.c/h & vfs-handle.c/h: There's no
		libgtranslator anylonger, change accordingly all the
		 copyright headers and comments.

2001-02-21  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* history.c: Extended the copyright line as Gediminas did much
		work there.

2001-02-20  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* find.c: fixed bug #51172, where you can reach an endlessloop

2001-02-20  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* sidebar.c/.h: Changed the gtranslator_sidebar_add_po
		to gtranslator_sidebar_activate_views as there's no po
		 file data used directly in the sidebar.

	* syntax.c/.h & parse.c: Free up some variables and optimize some
		kind for memory leaks.
	
	* parse.c: Also enable the different views for a "non-saveable"
		file.

	* update.c: Also added the "no good" case to the results matching
		-- or we are getting always successful updates.

	* header_stuff.c: Also convert the header comment back in case of
		no edit of the header edit dialog.

	* gui.c: Made a dot/special char also gettexted for solving some
		problems on "more special" characters sets and implemented
		 more checks for the text position.

	* syntax.c: Used a macro instead tons of the g_string_append_c
		call, makes the source better to read and put the Gtk+
		 position routines calls into the right order, so that the
		  syntax update now works as wished.

	* about.c, find.c: Fixed only cosmetical aspects.

	* vfs-handle.c: Made the routines use a GString, handling of
		relative filenames/filepaths is also done now and the
		 useless switch at the end is now also removed.

2001-02-20  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* find.c,find.h: Enhanced the find function.

2001-02-20  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* about.c: Added Thomas .-)

2001-02-19  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* vfs-handle.c: Fixed the local access routine, it should work
		now -- it does also work with relative paths.

	* gui.c: Hm, don't set the position not without testing the real
		index relations to the text widget.

	* syntax.c: Freeze/thaw up the text widgets before doing a complete
		syntax update.

	* dialogs.c: Reimplemented the Open from URI dialog and made it
		more simple this time -- the protocol checks are still
		 present though and a nice and small label is now also
		  there.

2001-02-18  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Made the comments box bigger and implemented 2
		functions which do prepare the header comment for view/edit
		 and save -- the header edit dialog displays now only the
		  comment without any # or free spaces.

	* gui.c: Hm, removed the "textlen" variable and connected stuff and
		reverted to old mechanism with gtranslator_syntax_update_text.

	* syntax.c: Added "@" to the syntax highlighted characters.

	* gui.c: The syntax highlighting does now work instantly without
		the gtranslator_syntax_update_text function so it doesn't
		 flicker any more.

	* dialogs.c, dialogs.h & gui.c: Added open from URI menu entry
		and added the logic around it -- it works.

	* ChangeLog: Changed Thomas' email address also here ,-)

2001-02-17  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c, find.h, find.c: strings are now found in the right
		categorie.

2001-02-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs_init.c & Makefile.am: Added this source file which does the
		1st time initialization for the most important preferences
		 items.

	* sidebar.c: Fixed #51000, the text gets now stored if the user
		changes the view.

	* gui.c: Rehighlight the complete widget after pasting something
		into the translation box.

2001-02-17  Thomas Ziehmer	<thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* syntax.c: refactoring of the code

2001-02-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c & syntax.c/.h: Added a "gtranslator_syntax_update_text"
		function which updates the given text widgets highlighting
		 and made it work immediately as you type.

	* syntax.c/htmlizer.c: Don't show assertion errors on untranslated
		messages as the msgstr is in this case empty -- avoid this
		 with conditionals.

	* dnd.c: Also use the new syntax enhanced text insertion method.

	* sidebar.c: Use the new "gtranslator_syntax_insert_text" method to
		also highlight comments.

	* syntax.c: Implemented color routine and made the syntax highlighting
		task -- it works great ,-)
	
	* gui.c: Use the new syntax routines to insert text instead of the old
		"gtk_text_insert" calls.

	* Makefile.am: Added syntax.c/.h to the sources.

	* syntax.c/.h: Added these syntax sources which will hold the
		syntax highlighting for gtranslator.

	* dialogs.c: Added search possibility for comments.

	* find.c: Also search for comments if wished via the find dialog.

	* \*.c: Changed also all the includes according to the move.

	* Makefile.am, shortcutbar.c/.h & sidebar.c/.h: Moved the sidebar
		sources to a more logical filename (sidebar.c/.h).

	* .cvsignore: Added the .sources backup dir of my own.

2001-02-16  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* shortcutbar.c: Added a function which shows an existing
		comment or displays an information message to the user
		 and removed all editable comments stuff -- why should
		  comments be editable on a per-message base?!

	* htmlizer.c: Corrected a small output error (do not also mark
		the brackets as links).

2001-02-15  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Make the header edit dialog resizable in growth
		direction -- no shrink allowed.

	* open-differently.c/.h: Moved the includes into the source file.

	* messages.h: Removed unused GList msgstr_list.

	* parse.c: Clear the sidebar via the new function if we do close
		a file.

	* shortcutbar.c/.h: Added the "gtranslator_sidebar_clean" function
		which clears the sidebar and corrected the comments showing
		 routine which does now really show you the message written
		  down in the source, if there's no comment for the current
		   message.

2001-02-14  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* preferences.h, vfs-handle.h & messages.h: Changed the include
		directives to use the gtranslator prefix "GTR" instead of
		 the old "LIBGTRANSLATOR" prefix.

	* main.c: Added an option to use the htmlizer functions and
		it works, works and works..

	* htmlizer.h/.c: Some reorganization, added recognition of %lx format
		arguments and added file output stuf around it.

	* gui.c: Do not include htmlizer.h -- we don't use it ever in
		gui.c.

	* history.c: Set the maximal number of history entries to
		10 for now.

	* shortcutbar.c: Remove the temporary header call & icon;
		implemented some kinds of views with the help of the
		 current GUI. Comments can get displayed now instead of
		  the msgid.

2001-02-13  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Made all conditional inclusion of GnomeVFS sources
		and functions normal used sources. Less ifdef/endifs.

	* Makefile.am: Added vfs sources generally, deleted not
		needed checks and XML flags.

	* open-differently.c: Also pass the local "file:/" URIs to
		GnomeVFS methods and use strcmp instead of g_strncasecmp.

2001-02-12  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* shortcutbar.c: Do not intend that we do have a MDI with "Files:";
		use "Views:" instead.

	* parse.c: Corrected a typo; successfull->successful.

2001-02-11  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am & gui.c: Removed any gtkhtml routines; we do not use
		gtkhtml anylonger.

	* about.c: Added the Free Software Foundation copyright; when did
		this disappear?!

2001-02-10  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* shortcutbar.c: Check for the filename before doing anything.

2001-02-09  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* htmlizer.c: Added string.h as an include as suggested by
		Josh Jackson, moved the "'" char to the quotation char
		 group again and added two new word classes for GNU and
		  GNOME words.

	* about.c: Changed the about messages as we don't have got any
		libgtranslator/gtranslatord anylonger.

	* *.c/.h: Moved the preferences.h header to prefs.h and all the files
		needing it include it from there already.

	* vfs-handle.c/.h & messages.h: Moved these files from libgtranslator
		to here.

	* Makefile.am: Don't link against libgtranslator because it isn't
	 	existent any longer -- removed the cflags and flags for it
		 and added the vfs handle sources and the message.h file to
		  the sources.

	* session.c, prefs.c, gui.c, history.c, dialogs.c & main.c:
		Changed the include dirs to be local as libgtranslator
		 is dead now.

	* parse.c, gui.c, prefs.c & history.c: Applied the
		changes from Gediminas for stable also to HEAD.

	* Makefile.am: Do link against the new static library in
		libgtranslator, add all the new sources.
	
	* preferences.c/.h: Moved from libgtranslator to here.

	* stylistics.c/.h: Moved also to here and included the
		gnome-i18n.h header for problemless build.

2001-02-08  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Made GAL & GtkHTML flags used by default.

	* parse.c & gui.c: Made all conditional uses of GAL & GtkHTML
		use the enhanced GAL & GtkHTML actions by default as they're
		 now requirements for HEAD.

2001-02-06  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* shortcutbar.c: Don't show the full filename in the shortcut bar;
		just show the project name and the base filename.

2001-02-05  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: open working dir in save as dialog also.
	* header_stuff.c: if no project version is set do not write space after
	name ;). Fixed stupid error with \n in comment.
	* history.c: implement "Check if the file exists" option. Save only
	8 entries.
	* parse.c: in file open callback, close old file before opening new.
	Implement "warn user about fuzzy mesages left" option.
	* prefs.c: do not free internal font name.

2001-02-04  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: Open dialog shows the same dir as current file.
	* parse.c: avoid crash in free_po() if po=NULL.
	
2001-02-04  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: get not-localized language only from language
	name, not from other fields. Fix a crash. Ensure comment ends with \n.
	* history.c: show nice menu items: 1. project 3.14 -- lt.po. Install
	menu hints into appbar.

2001-02-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c, gui.h, parse.c: Removed the locally defined
		shortcut bar stuff as we do now have general
		 handles for it in shortcutbar.c/.h.

	* Makefile.am: Integrate the new sources conditionally.

	* shortcutbar.c/.h: New sources for shortcut bar stuff.

2001-02-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* open-differently.c: Corrected the opening of the "special"
		po files -- don't forget the GnomeVFS case.

	* gui.c: Added crusty shortcut bar stuff and added a default
		"Files" group which should always be present.

	* parse.c: Also create a shortcut bar entry for the po file
		-- just cosmetic for now.

	* gui.h: Define the globally used EShortcutModel and include
		the corresponding gal header already there.

	* htmlizer.c: Changed the color of quote characters also
		to red.

	* gui.c: Added some gal parts like an e-vpaned and a
		shortcut bar which is empty for now -- all is
		 conditionally defined -- no gal, no e-vpaned etc.

	* gui.c: Also disable editing of the GtkHTML msgid display.

	* history.c/.h: Added Gediminas to the authors line .-)

2001-02-03  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* history.c: renamed "history_length" to "history/length" for
	gnome-config. When reading, append to list, so newest entries are
	always at top. History works with gnome-config now. Not yet with
	gconf...

2001-02-03  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	Almost fixed history stuff.
	* gui.c, parse.*, history.*: renamed gtranslator_display_recent() to
	gtranslator_history_show() and moved from parse* to history*. the same
	with parse_the_file_from_the_recent_files_list() ->
	open_file_from_history().
	* history.c: removed lots of fake variable initializers and leaks ;).
	Replaced gtranslator_history_assort with remove_duplicate_entries, which
	removes duplicates of one entry, used only on history_add.
	* Makefile.am: build ./ before pixmaps/.

2001-02-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* pixmaps/.cvsignore: Added cvs ignore again for HEAD.

	* gui.c: Use the new htmlizer code and gtkhtml for the msgid
		part if we're working with gtkhtml -- this is like a
		 preview for the further work for the msgstr part.

2001-02-02  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* htmlizer.c/.h: Added html making helper sources; very
		simple though.

	* Makefile.am: Added GtkHTML flags for building linking and
		the new htmlizer.c/.h sources to the build.

	* main.c: Changed the <libgtranslator/parse-db.h> include to
		<libgtranslator/libgtranslator.h>.

	* gui.c: Changed the webaddress to http://www.gtranslator.org

2001-02-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: Perhaps the Save as dialog will also detect
		a previously remote po file and will offer a direct
		 save as filename.

	* gui.c & parse.c: Also disable the Save button for the
		"remotely" copied po files.

	* open-differently.c: Made the remote stuff finally really
		work for all supported kinds of po files; take the
		 local copy of the remote file as the 'local' file.

2001-01-31  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* open-differently.c: Also use the VFS methods to open
		a remote po file via GnomeVFS -- if present.
	
	* parse.c: Moved the check for file existence before the check
		for read/write permissions.

2001-01-30  Simos Xenitellis  <simos@hellug.gr>

	* languages.h: Added entry for the Greek language.

2001-01-30  Thomas Ziehmer <thomas@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Use the new history functions <damn-it/>.

	* .cvsignore: Add ".gdbinit" to the ignores.

	* Makefile.am: Added the new history sources and reordered the
		source files alphabetically.

	* parse.c: Removed all core stuff for the recent files/history.

	* history.c/.h: New history sources.

2001-01-28  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Changed a hotkey to work (it's the "Message status"
		menu entry).

2001-01-27  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Get the language name from the languages
		list and don't write localized language names to the
		 po files.

	* parse.c: If the po file header does still have got the
		default values, on startup the "Edit Header" dialog
		 will now pop up to make it possible to change the
		  header fields to the corresponding values.

	* parse.c & parse.h: New history/recent files stuff which
		is now gtranslator_config_* based; could work in
		 the next time.

	* gui.c & parse.c: Don't enable the save buttons if the
		user doesn't have got direct write permissions.

	* dialogs.c: More write protection detection; save file
		as dialog is now more enhanced for perms.

	* parse.c/.h: Don't write immediately if the user
		doesn't have got write permissions on the
		 po file -- detect this permission while
		  parsing the po file.
	

	* gui.c, prefs.h & prefs.c: Removed all multiple dot
		char stuff and reverted to the old dot char
		 stuff -- but the "dot char" is now also
		  "gettexted", so that it should also be usable
		    with Japanese/Ukrainian charsets.

2001-01-24  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Fiddling with the new multiple dot char stuff.

		2001.
	
	* parse.c/.h: Added a function to check the access perms
		for the po files.
	
	* about.c: Changed the copyright years.

2001-01-21  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* pixmaps/untrans.xpm: added this dir and one pixmap for untranslated
		toolbar button.
	* gui.c: use it. Fixed ispell command constructing.
	* header_stuff.c: reformatted *'s
	* parse.c: removed some checks and leaks. Rewritten
		gtranslator_display_recent completely, now works.
	* prefs.c: load/save dictionary entry. Made it simple entry, because it
	does not need to be a file, just name.
	* prefs.h: whitespace.

2001-01-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Added code which determines if a special dictionary
		is desired and then calls the gtkspell ispell process
		 with the corresponding options (or not).

	* prefs.c/.h: Added the dictionary holding entry for the
		ispell process of gtkspell.

	* prefs.h, parse.c: Removed the recent files entries from the

		the corresponding preference is set, corrected
		 the check for the temporary file name to use
		  strcmp and work right.

	* open-differently: Allocate the gchars newly before freeing
		them.

2001-01-04  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	Ran gtranslator in memprof. Several memleaks found.

	* gui.c: free msgstr before getting new text in update_msg
	* parse.c: s/  \*/ */
	(append_line) simplify making result string.
	(gtranslator_display_recent) "name" was not neccesarry. do not strdup
	static strings. Free menu->hint.

2001-01-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Delete the temporary file after saving the messages to
		a new file, build the right name for the files, changed
		 the name of the temporary file to "gtranslator-temp-po-file"
		  and made it also possible to open gzip'ed and compiled
		   gettext po files from the GUI via the open dialog and the
		    recent files list; don't take the temporary files into
		     the recent files list.
	
	* parse.c/.h, languages.h, header-stuff.c/.h, gui.c/.h: Reformatted

	not remember orig_mouse.
	* gui.c/.h: moved create_popup_menu declaration from .h to .c. Moved

	always destroy it. Changed type of function to match prototype, return
	FALSE/TRUE.

2001-01-03  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gtkspell.c: (popup menu) fixed tests for which button is pressed and

	        Reformatted these files.

	* gtkspell.c: Changed the mouse button on which
		the gtkspell suggestion list reacts from
		 the right one (which is already used by the
		  eventually enabled pop up menu) to the
		   middle one (this is only conditional; if the
		    po-pup menu is disabled, it's still on the

	* spell.c/.h: Removed these old some files.

	* Makefile.am: Removed spell.c/.h from the sources.

	* gui.c: Fix memory leak in update_appbar (str was not freed).
	change status logic a bit, to make it simpler.
	* prefs.c: fix size of sixth page table. check if font is saved in
	preferences, only then set it.
	
2000-12-29  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Include the new files altogether in a build,
		removed the "SophInterfaceFiles" from the EXTRA_DIST
		 and it's targetism.

2000-12-28  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Include also the open-po-file-dialog sources.

2000-12-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Disable the Spell checking menu entries on startup.

2000-12-15  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: if there were no comments, do not print (null).
	* gui.c: do not replace dots with spaces, exchange them! So now dots are
	not lost, they just look like spaces. (in show-centered-dot mode).

2000-12-09  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Hmm, stupid error... Forgot to write the else
		part of the condition if the filename if "temp_po_file";
		 now the save part should again work...

2000-12-08  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c/.h: Added a gtranslator_open_gzipped_po_file function
		which does work like gtranslator_open_mo_file but it does
		 it's job for a gzip'ed po-file.

	* main.c: Also open up gmo-files as they're the same as
		mo-files and do use the same plain stuff for gzip'ed
		 po-files as for mo-files .. without using GnomeVFS.

	* parse.c: Also allow opening mo/gmo-files from the open file
		dialog.

2000-12-07  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: (str_replace) added function which quickly replaces dots with
	spaces.
	Moved NONE declaration into function to avoid misuse.
	(display_msg, update_msg) substitute spaces with dots in temp variable,
	leave msg clean. msgid is never altered. Removed unneeded check if
	string is blank.
	(update_appbar) do NOT put anything else than ACT_... in call to
	disable_actions!
	(text_has_got_changed) optimize a lot drawing with dots. Redraw not
	all the text, only spaces :) set nothing_changes = TRUE when changing
	anything. Do NOT initialize variables with empty values! Free newstr (a
	GREAT leak).
	* parse.c: (parse) fix disable_actions. Do not activate trans_box.
	(restore_msg) removed dot char stuff, it is handled elsewhere.
	(write_the_message) ditto.

2000-12-06  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Determine if the given file has got
		the suffix ".mo" and open it with the

	* parse.c/.h: Added the a new function
		( gtranslator_open_mo_file ), which opens up
		   a mo-file ( the compiled gettext files )
		    by calling msgunfmt and teeing it's output
		     to a temporary file...
		Changed the arguments of a file from being
		 "const char *" to "const gchar *", added a
		  saving part for the mo-file function which
		   gets it's informations from the "temp_po_file"
		    name which should only be used temporarily.

2000-12-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Added more VFS stuff, so it
		tries to get the file via GnomeVFS
		 interface...

2000-12-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Added the conditional close-down of
		GnomeVFS if USE_VFS_STUFF is defined and
		 already running.

2000-11-12  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Prevent gtranslator from crashing
		if there aren't any previous files.

	* Makefile.am: Added the LIBGLADE_LIBS to the

		  data Makefiles.

2000-10-30  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Removed the include-dir ../libgtranslator as
		all libgtranslator headers are now globally declared
		 and the $top_srcdir include-dir is enough for this.
	
	* main.c: Also made it include only the <libgtranslator/...>
		headers instead of simply doing "...".

2000-10-30 Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: moved Update menu item just after Compile. Enable Status/Fuzzy
		menu entry after Open. Focus translation box during startup.
		Fixed some initialization of variables.
	* gui.c, parse.c: fixed various places where messages were counted.
		Removed extra update_appbar calls. Use po->length instead of
		g_list_length(po->messages).
	* parse.c: made	determine_translation_status static.  Create menu path
		only once in gtranslator_display_recent. Initialize counts to 0
		in get_translated_count. Simplified percentage count, now shows
		correctly. Removed onepercent variable.

2000-10-29  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Change the corresponding calls to the gtranslator_set_style
		function, as it does only take one argument now; call the
		 function twice, one time for the text box and one time
		  for the translation box.

2000-10-25  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.h, parse.h & spell.c: Changed the includes
		to <libgtranslator/messages.h> due to the move.
	
	* messages.h: Removed it from here. Moved it to libgtranslator.

2000-10-23  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Also added here the "/usr/X11R6/lib" to the
		$LDFLAGS for gtranslator; the source packages should
		 now again build without problems.

2000-10-20  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Also disable the corresponding buttons if no fuzzy/
		untranslated messages seem to have been residential
		 in the po-file.

	* parse.c: Corrected the place of the decrementing statement
		for the translated count.

2000-10-18  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c/h: Added another function which sets up the progress bar
		status ( gtranslator_set_progress_bar() ).
	
	* parse.c: Use this new function for the progress bar setting routines
		now, disable the "Fuzzy", "Untranslated" buttons on the parse
		 start and enable them only if there's a fuzzy, untranslated
		  message. Another bug has been removed :-)

2000-10-17  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Set the left fuzzy/untranslated messages inside the status
		text and set the progress bar corresponding to the current
		 status and hopefully update the fuzzy count in the status
		  messages and the untranslated messages count is now
		   updated somehow working =?

	* parse.c: Get the count at the startup and set the progress bar
		corresponding to the values ( also get the fuzzy count );
		 on closure of the file set the progress bar value to 0.

	* parse.h: do use "fuzzy" and "translated" fields for the determi-
		nition of the message status. Include two new functions
		 which should build the progress bar total and other sources
		  for status informations ( these are "get_translated_count"
		   for the list of messages and "determine_translation_status"
		    for the determination of the status itself ).
		Moved the two gfloat values to the header as they're globally
		 used now.

	* gui.c: Also have a progress bar in the GNOME appbar.

2000-10-15  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Set the font and the colors on startup via the new
		gtranslator_set_style() function which should do more
		 work but it's enough for now; include the new
		  "libgtranslator/stylistics.h" header for the function
		   gtranslator_set_style().

	* parse.c: Activate the translation box on the successful of a
		po-file.

	* prefs.h: Added the "font" gchar as part of the wants structure and
		added a function to set the style.

	* prefs.c: Use the new color getting/setting routines from
		libgtranslator, get/set the font name in the preferences and
		 the function to set the style.

2000-10-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: Removed the corresponding check button for the removed
		option and added a sixth page with the font and color
		 settings; added the widgets and labels for this, connected
		  the signals with the widgets and began to write the stuff
		   around this.

	* prefs.h: Removed the option to delete obsolete entries from the
		recent file menus and added the option to use own specs
		 for font and colors.

        * TODO.src: Removed it and added some points of it to the top level
                TODO file.
 
        * Makefile.am: Also removed the TODO.src file here.

2000-10-12  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: Changed the description text for the option to delete
		obsolete recent file menu entries as it does only remove
		 double entries following each other.

	* parse.c: Don't re-parse the file if no change would be applied
		to the po-file, inform the user about the not-existing
		 change; reverse the list of recent files as we're parsing
		  it reversely in our routine.

	* gui.c: Thaw up the translation text at the end of the process,
		get/set the pointer index by the gtk_editable_(g|s)et_position
		 functions, handle the translation text box as a GtkEditable;
		  now the dot char mode works as wished :-)

2000-10-11  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Call the gtranslator_display_recent() function every
		time a new file is opened; this function should now really
		 remove somehow all previous recent files entries from the
		  menus and insert the new ones and implemented the first
		   lines in direction to deleting obsolete multiple commons
		    of the same file.

	* gui.c: Also update the status bar information on changing the
		status from "Untranslated" to "Translated".

	* Makefile.am: Include the necessary GConf cflags for compiling
		and linking gtranslator.

	* gui.c: Solved the FIXME and "removed" the reverse writing
		"feature" of gtranslator :-)
		Wrong places for the freeze/thaw up calls of the GtkText,
		 this has been corrected and it works now again also in
		  dot char mode.

2000-10-07  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Removed the error warning about GConf as it works
		now again.

	* Makefile.am: Compiling and added the SCRIPTSDIR define to the
		 compile defines.

	* parse.c: Clean up the appbar when closing a file, wrote the
		update function which uses the "changed" update.sh script
		 from here to work; close the file before updating it and
		  open it then again.

	* gui.c: Freeze and thaw the translation box during updating
		the contents and delete all the characters in the
		 translation box forwardly, added a FIXME as it goes
		  to the index 0 though I want it to go somewhere else.
		Store the date via gtranslator_config_set_last_run_date()
		 on exit.

	* prefs.c: Changed the update policy of the GtkSpinButton to
		GTK_UPDATE_ALWAYS, added the toggle button for the new
		 toggle button and added another toggle button to switch
		  off these nice dialogs within the update function.
	
	* prefs.h: Added the delete_obsolete_rfentries value and the
		uzi_dialogs values to the wants structure.

2000-10-06  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* languages.h: Corrected the German mailing list address.

	* parse.c: Added an undotchar function which undotchars
		the texts _with_ regarding special cases like
		 quoting or special use with the ",',Åœ etc. chars.

	* parse.h: Added the prototype for the new parse_the_file
		function which is used from the "Recent files" menu.

	* parse.c: Use the new option to determine how many entries
		should go into this nice "Recent files" menu; added
		 hotkeys in front of the numbers, check for existence
		  of the file and call the corresponding new function
		   which is only intended to be used from this point
		    ( ->parse_the_file_from_recent_files_list ).

	* prefs.c: Added a fifth page with a GtkSpinButton with
		which you can define now how many recent files should
		 be in the "Recent files" menu and added an option
		  with which you can let gtranslator check every file
		   in the "Recent files" list for existence and if
		    it doesn't exist, then it isn't shown up in the
		     list.
		Perform two checks for the value of the recent files
		 number, if it's below 2 set it to 2 ( or it wouldn't
		  be named "Recent file_s_" :)).

	* prefs.h: Added the recent_files guint variable for the
		number of files wished to be in the Recent files
		 menu.

	* gui.c: Changed the pop up menu to show only the useful
		parts of itself, it's useful enough for now; the
		 "Recent" files menu is improved now for a better
		  style, no useless label widget and separator there
		   now.
	
	* parse.c: Changed the routines a bit, and added the option to
		set the number of entries hold in the Recent files menu
		( minimum 1, maximum 10 ).

2000-10-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Added "Recent files" sub menu into the File tree and
		put some dope stuff around it.

	* parse.c/h: Added Recent file menus on top of the libgnome's
		gnome_history interface. It works! Still needs
		 preferences merging...

	* parse.c/h: Added the update function's skeleton -- nothing
		real has been written yet.

	* prefs.c: Added another option to disable the update function
		as you need the original package sources for this
		 ( gtranslator will use the update.pl scripts in the
		    ./po-dir for this ) and as you need the sources.

	* gui.c: Added an "Update" button to the toolbar and to the
		menus; till now this hasn't got any use as the function
		 isn't written yet but that will happen soon....
		Enable/Disable this entry & button accordingly to the
		 option set in the preferences and to the case if a
		  file is opened or not.

2000-10-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Added more "live" status bar update for the status
		information on change of a fuzzy message, removed
		 the now obsolete FIXME entries and corrected some
		  wrong enable/disable actions.

	* parse.c: Check if msgfmt is installed in $PATH, and show up
		and gnome_app_error if it can't be found by the
		 gnome_is_program_in_path routine from libgnome.
		Don't free a string variable ( "frees" a crash ) and
		 check if we'd used the new dot char feature and if so
		  replace the dot chars again with free spaces. This does
		   solve all FIXME's. Hurray.

	* \*.c: Added 3 FIXME's which are the three places where
		gtranslator crashes regularly; these are FIXME's :)

2000-10-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Added some more conditionals in hope of avoiding more
		crashes, changed the descriptions of the new page's
		 toggle buttons a bit and removed a g_free as I can't
		  see any reason why to free a variable which is again
		   filled 10 lines after the free-ing process.
		Only react if the option is set in the preferences.

	* prefs.c: Added a 4th page with the options to use the dot char
		feature and to enable/disable the pop up menu. Both of them
		 are working in real-time, you can also immediately see the
		  changes in the preferences on the next screen; also moved
		   the save geometry option to the "Miscellaneous" page.

	* parse.c: Add a new GNOME history entry if the file should be parsed,
		so we can later use it in a "Recent files" menu or a favorites
		 or something-alike menu.

2000-10-02  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Put the main.c file at the start of the
		compilation process.

	* main.c: Added an #error define to "avoid" GConf compilations
		for now.

	* gui.c: Changed the pop up menu a bit and integrated some
		 kind of more intelligent menu ( though it's too
		  big and doesn't have got intelligence like the
		   tool bar till now ... ).
		Added a beta-alpha version of the dot char-stuff
		 which does cause more crashs... grrrr...

2000-10-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Only activate the pop up-menu for the two
		text boxes.

	* \*.*: Removed all gtranslator_config_init &
		gtranslator_config_close calls as libgtranslator's
		 functions are doing this now on their own.

2000-09-30  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Added the pop up-menu for gtranslator; it
		reacts only on right click on the text-boxes
		 and should be more expanded later on; also
		  added another menu which some entries.

	* gui.h: Added the prototype for the popup-menu.

	* parse.c: Also free the segments of the GString.

	* main.c: Removed the error message stuff.

	* session.c: Removed some unneeded stuff.

2000-09-29  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: More informations on a GConf error.

2000-09-24  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c, header_stuff.c, session.c & prefs.c:
		Adapted the settings variables to GConf-style.

	* dnd.h: Moved the D'n'D types and enumeration to the
		right places.
	
	* gui.c: The GtkTargetEntries are now settled in here.

	* dnd.h: The enumeration of the D'n'D types is now here.

	* dialogs.c, header_stuff.c & session.c : Include the
		libgtranslator/preferences.h header for the
		 preferences routines of libgtranslator.

	* main.c: Include the GConf header if necessary and
		take the right argument style to the
		 gconf_init function :)

2000-09-23  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: Init the GConf library if it's present.

	* find.c: Check if we did get any message before operating
		on it.

2000-09-21  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: Include the "libgtranslator/preferences.h" header.

	* header_stuff.c & dialogs.c: Use only relative paths as this
		would cause a mess in libgtranslator.

	* \*.c: Merged all gnome_config routines to use the libgtranslator
		routines.

	* prefs.c: Use "Do not..." for "Don't..." in the preferences
		settings.

2000-09-20  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Don't let me say that this correction has got also
		something to do with the icons in the search bar ...

2000-09-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* \*.c/h: Reformatted my mail appearance from '[ kabalak@gtranslator.org ]'
		to '<kabalak@gtranslator.org>'.

	* gui.c: Integrated the status information into the status bar and made
		some corrections to these weird search bar stuff; it should
		 now get disabled/enabled the right way.

2000-09-16  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Made some more messages translatable and removed the
		check_file function; we're now using the libgnome-function
		 g_file_exists for that. If there's no such file, it does
		  now use a gnome_app_error to display the error, doesn't
		   parse anything and the app is still there ( hehe,
		    no crash ).
	
		Also disabled the Save button if the file has been saved
		 and haven't been changed since then.

	* parse.h: Removed the check_file prototype as the function
		isn't used/included anymore.

	* gui.c: Corrected another wrong addiction (icon number was wrong),
		added also a fuzzy icon to the search bar and made the Fuzzy
		 icon react with the same intelligence like the Missing
		   icon.

2000-09-15  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: The file is now named TODO.src and not only
		TODO.

	* gui.c: Enable the Goto button if a file has been opened and
		disable the menu entry for "Undo" if no file hasn't
		 been opened; also corrected the wrong menu entry
		  behavior.

2000-09-13  Jesus Bravo Alvarez  <jba@pobox.com>

	* languages.h: Modified Galician team's e-mail address.

2000-09-13  Robert Brady  <rbrady@suse.de>

	* header-stuff.c: (split_name_email) Don't crash if
	str == NULL.

	(get_header) Deal with Project-Id-Version: lines with
	missing version numbers.

	* gui.c: Disable the translation string box if
	no .po is loaded.
	
2000-09-13  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Changed the hotkey for the next fuzzy translation
		to Alt + Z ( slightens the menus a bit ) and changed
		 the icon-caption to "Missing" as this doesn't break
		  the look of the tool bar.

2000-09-12  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gnome-regex.*: reverted to original files from gnome-libs,
		just added 'flags' field to GnomeRegexCache, and check for it
		before comparing patterns. Start search from 0th item
		(was 1st).
	* find.c: for_each_msg -- fail if start item == NULL; iterate on any
		list, not messages. In other functions, added check to pass not
		NULL to this function.
	* dialogs.c: made find dialog option fit in one line.

2000-09-11  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Removed msg_db.* as they'ren't any longer in
		our sources.

	* msg_db.*: Removed these files as we'll give the duty for this
		to gtranslatord.

	* prefs.c/h: Removed all message db parts.

	* gui.c: Removed all message db concerning menus & icons.

	* dialogs.c/h: Removed the query dialog & the query results
		dialogs for now ( including all widgets and variables.)

	* main.c: Removed all msg_db stuff and also cleansed the options
		and message db inits.

2000-09-10  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added the gnome-regex sources to the build sources
		without any conditional tests ( libgnome doesn't have got
		 the gnome_regex_cache_new_with_size ).
	
2000-08-23  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c, parse.c: now absolute file name is got in parse(), wherever
		it was called from. Added some newline, removed some comments,
		to ease the reading of huge parse() and main() functions.
		Ensured file_opened is always in sane state and is checked
		before doing anything with po structure (this avoids
		segfaults).
	* ChangeLog: why lose so much space on this file -- reformatted
		Fatih's	entries to be like mine. So there's half lines, but
		size reduced only by 3k...
	* gui.c: destroy regex cache on quit.
	* parse.c: created actual_parse function, and moved to it the real
		parsing from parse() to make it more clean. Change the title
		of window to contain the filename. In actual_write, check if
		the file has *.pot extension; if so, warn and do nothing.
	* spell.h, spell.c, gui.c: moved spelling code from gui.c to new
		separate files.
	* Makefile.am: added those two files to sources.
	* find.c: in for_each_msg, reverted to jump to po->messages when NULL
		reached, because of problem when passing first == NULL.
	* dialogs.c: added fake option menu to select where to find in.

2000-08-22  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: in update_msg, make both msgid and msgstr end with or without
		'\n'.
	* session.*, main.c: added restore_session(), if client is restored. So
		now goes to the same file and message number.
	* dialog.c: renamed variables in goto_dlg to shorter ones; added policy
		set on spin; changed dialog and label titles.

2000-08-21  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: some cosmetic changes, use variables instead of simple
		../. Added -DGNOMELOCALEDIR. Added check for
		HAVE_MY_REGEX_CACHE, if to compile and link gnome-regex.
	* main.c: use realpath for getting absolute path.
	* session.c: gtranslator now opens the same file on session restore.
		Removed non-interesting comments.
	
2000-08-21  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: yeah, at last this works perfectly. Too much changes
		to list, anyway it's almost complete rewrite. Changed only
		get_header, put_header and edit_header. Use regexps to parse
		fields. A VERY enhanced edit dialog.

2000-08-20  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.*, messages.h, dialogs.c, gui.c, find.c, session.c: at last
		moved all file-specific stuff to GtrPo structure, in that
		inserted new field -- messages list 'length'.
	* header_stuff.*: in GtrHeader, splitted language_team into two fields:
		language and lg_email; also, replaced 'mime_type' with
		'charset'.
	
2000-08-20  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gnome-regex.h, gnome-regex.c: copied these files here from
		gnome-libs/libgnome, because I needed to change the cache
		object so that it stored compilation flags along with pattern
		and regex. Added new type GnomeRegexCacheSlot, for saving all
		info about one regex. Also, changed everything else to reflect
		this change. Function API did not change, just added new
		function: gnome_regex_cache_new_with_size. However, types HAVE
		changed, although they should be used only internally.
	* Makefile.am: added above new files, although should be checked if
		they are needed.
	* parse.h: added check for gnome library version, which I will
		commit my above changes to. Use local file, if not found.
	* msg_db.*: Cleaned up a lot, fixed much errors, got no warnings.
		Though not needed...
	* find.c: in for_each_msg, get first element of given list, not
		messages.

2000-08-17  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* Again big changes. Read below: prefs.h, almost all .c: Instead of
		many if_* variables for preferences, created one structure
		'wants.*', which uses only one bit for toggles.
	* prefs.c: new option: if message was fuzzy, when changed, it could be
		marked non-fuzzy. Changed order of options in dialog. Moved all
		#defines to where they are used, and inserted #undefs
		immediately after. Authors name & e-mail are now GtkEntry's,
		not GnomeEntry's.
	* parse.c, gui.c: made check_msg_status internal, used only for
		parsing. Other functions (update_msg and mark_msg_fuzzy) change
		the status themselves. Rewritten update_msg,
		toggle_msg_status. Now all the job with fuzzy entries does
		mark_msg_fuzzy function. After toggling status, message is
		updated. In text_has_got_changed, added call to unmark fuzzy,
		if wanted.
	* messages.h: moved all typedefs to struct/enum, so we don't need _Type
		hacks. Rewritten GtrPo type, to contain entries we actually
		use.
	* And, while changed much, executable has got only 700 bytes, so it was
		worth work.

2000-08-17  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.*: added mark_msg_fuzzy function, which does actual change to
		message comment. Renamed get_msg_status to update_msg_status
		and changed return type to void. Added rxc -- a regexp cache.
	* gui.*: added a simple 'Undo' menuitem, ACT_UNDO action,
		undo_changes function. When toggled fuzzy status, call
		mark_msg_fuzzy.
	* find.c: use regexps to find. Added update_flags for match case
		updating.
	* main.c: create rxc and change it's size.
	
2000-08-16  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dnd.*, find.*, parse.*: just another rearrangement of #include's.
	* dnd.*: removed gtr_dnd_type -- use guint instead. Removed a_counter
		variable, cleaned up lots of comments.
	* .cvsignore: added tags & .libs

2000-08-15  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.*, header_stuff.c: Lots of changes: moved all language lists to
		prefs.h, introduced lang_ref reference counting variable,
		create_lists() and destroy_lists(). All attach_*_with_label()
		are now in prefs.h, i.e. can be used with any other dialog.
		That was done because edit_header now creates GnomePropertyBox,
		not just dialog, and lets change language properties in header.

2000-08-14  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: simplified main() function, by moving geometry stuff to
		prefs.*. Query now only prints the result, no sick messages.
	* prefs.*: created save_geometry() and restore_geometry(), removed
		gtranslator_geometry_* variables, so that other files do not
		have anything to do with geometry. Geometry is loaded only if
		wanted. Added GTR_CONFIG_PREFIX.
	* gui.c: simplified gtranslator_quit.
	
2000-08-10  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: initial spell checking support. It does not work well,
		but works! I was impressed when I found gnome-spell.h!
	
2000-08-10  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* find.*, gui.*: renamed search_do to find_do. Created new
		for_each_msg function, which works the same as g_list_foreach,
		except that it starts from specified position, and jumps to
		first when end reached. All functions in find.h now uses it.
		Added goto_next_untranslated function, action and callback.
	* gui.c: fixed toggle_msg_status (rewrite). Created new
		function enable_actions_just_opened, which is just a statement,
		for convenience moved from parse.c. ACT_END is now initialized
		to NULL, I think it introduced a crash before.
		update_msg now marks message as untranslated if the
		translation was removed.

2000-08-09  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.[ch]: added update_header function, which
		PO-Revision_Date field.
	* parse.c: called above from actual_write().
	* find.[ch], gui.[ch]: added new menu item -- "Next fuzzy", callback
		for it, ACT_NEXT_FUZZY action (which is disabled when there are
		no more fuzzy messages).

2000-08-08  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.[ch]: added put_header (what a bad name...) function.
		Also, enriched GtrHeader structure with comment field, filled
		it in get_header and freed in free_header.
	* parse.c: because of above change, removed header_li variable. Now the
		header list item is completely destroyed, and created a new
		message when writing the file. Also, give a warning if file has
		no header. In parse(), prepend a message to messages, and then
		reverse - optimization for speed. Removed some comments, where
		the code was self-explanatory. Added a check if any line was
		read, if none -- give an error (and do not crash :)). In
		compile() -- write the po-file to temporary one, and compile
		this -- so you don't need to save before compile.

2000-08-08  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: added update_appbar function and call to it. This shows
		current message in the status bar. Also connected
		clear_selection callback.
	* parse.c: when compiling, show two dialogs, depending on success:
		a message with message counts, or an error message.
	* dialogs.c: added compile_error_dialog function, which shows error
		text, which occurred during compiling.

2000-08-07  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* *.*: reformatted everything with "indent -i8 -kr -l78 -fca -fc1".
		From now I will use Linux kernel coding style
		(/usr/src/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle).
	* gui.[ch]: complete rewrite of "actions" code. Hash table was replaced
		by a static array, and string identifiers -- by integer IDs.
		This prevents typos, and saves a lot of memory and time. Also
		done some reformatting of code and comments (removed some of
		them).
	* find.c: optimized search functions, implemented case insensitive
		search.
	
2000-08-06  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* *.*: got the CVS 2000-08-04 version, today merged them all. I see
		now, that almost none changes made here by Fatih, only by me.
		That's good. gui.c, dialogs.c, prefs.c were totally rewritten
		by me, diff was confused :).
	* main.c: removed free(langs) because we do not own system environment.
		init the msg_db and parse-db only if if_use_msg_db is TRUE.
		Removed pointless pushing - and popping of prefix. Moved query
		handle to front, because then we do not need anything more.
		Also, moved parsing of file after creating the app (if there
		are problems with gui, don't bother with parsing). Because
		filename setting is done in parse(), removed
		gtranslator_set_filename from here.
	* prefs.c: made not use msg db by default, as I could not make program
		not to crash myself.
	* header_stuff.c: fixed that mime_type was not read. Also made new
		header to be filled with zeroes, in case some header field was
		not available.
	* gui.h and so on: moved some #includes to gui.c, this caused
		more #includes to change in another files. Hope now compiles
		faster.
	* find.*: removed crazy stuff (everything :)) and moved search_do
		function to here.
	* gui.c: because goto_given_msg(GList *) already existed, simplified
		all other goto_* to one line with call to it.

2000-08-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* TODO.src: Added some thoughts.
	
	* ChangeLog: Reformatted my entries partly.

2000-08-04  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* about.c: Updated the about-message.

        * ChangeLog: Merged with menesis' ChangeLog.

	* main.c: Added the gettext-init of the poptTable.

	* session.c: disabled the filename storage for now.

2000-08-04  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.*: done the SAME :) with find dialog. That is, made gnome
		dialog with icon/parent/wmclass...
	* prefs.[ch],dialogs.c,header_stuff.c: two new preferences:
		if_match_case (for find dialog) and if_fill_header (for edit
		header dialog). Save them to config.
	* gui.c: written the search_do function and connected it where needed!
		Added a function goto_given_msg, which accepts list item as
		user_data.
	
2000-08-03  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: ended cleanup. Instead of defines, made some functions to
		simplify creating of many similar entries. Will use soon in
		edit_header, maybe...
	* parse.c: fixed the bug with ~ and ! :) now should get correct status.

2000-08-02  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: a major cleanup. Moved all widgets from .h to .c and made
		them static, removed unused ones. Added free_prefs(), which
		cleans memory, allocated with read_prefs; also, prefs_box_close
		callback, which destroys the lists when box closes. Moved the
		code, which initializes the lists, _before_ settting the entries
		with saved values. Added lots of #defines, so that code was more
		readable, because there were lots of very similar lines. Made
		apply callback react only to page_num==-1.
	* main.c,...: moved some variables used only here from various .h.
		There's almost no warnings now...

2000-08-01  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added the libgtranslator dir to the includes
		and to the LDFLAFS/LDADD variables.

2000-08-01  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* prefs.c: Simplified widget creation and initialization, perhaps just
		removed lots of whitespace... Sorted items in the lists, and
		left only unique ones.

2000-07-31  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: made a new modal ask_to_save_file dialog, It is more
		simple and works perfect! Even in open_file, I used this
		to ask if to save current file before opening new one.
	* gui.[ch]: do not declare gtranslator_quit in gui.h. Changed the
		type of this callback to such as it should be. Applied the
		above change, so modified files are always saved, if the user
		wants to. Added close callback and "action".
	* parse.c: changed the argument of parse(const char*). Made a simplier
		dialog to ask if saving unchanged files. The same to reverting
		a file. Also, used the nice ask_to_save_file, now saving,
		opening, closing and reverting is simple, consistent and safe.

2000-07-30  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* main.c: removed -f option from popt table, instead used context for
		getting files to load from command line. Now a file can be
		loaded simply by 'gtranslator lt.po'. Removed duplicating
		testing if file is valid, and a bunch of non-interesting
		comments and braces {}.
	* prefs.c: minor changes -- added some default values, removed
		gnome_config_drop_all() call, because this is done
		automatically.

2000-07-28  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: added ask_to_save function, to be used when closing
		application, and file is unsaved. It works now.
	* gui.*: added disable_actions_no_file, because it is used
		in main.c and when closing file. Added nothing_changes
		variable, it was needed in text_has_got_changed to determine if
		the user or program changes the textbox. Added the callback for
		revert. gtranslator_quit now checks if file was changed. Also,
		closes it (frees the memory). Moved setting of status in front
		of file, because only then it could be seen. Message status in
		menus now reflects to real state of message (display_msg).
	* parse.*: added revert_file and close_file callbacks. Also,
		free_messages function.

2000-07-24  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>
	
	* Everywhere: renamed type names to conform with Glib ones:
		gtr_msg now is GtrMsg, type cast is GTR_MSG(), the same for
		status, header, action, po.
	* header_stuff.c,parse.c: at last header parsing is complete!
		get_header works fine. Edit header dialog also works, though
		there's not much... (maybe shouldn't be).
	* dialogs.c,prefs.c,about.c: added check GNOME_IS_DIALOG(*dlg) to
		show_nice_dialog, so if *dlg is a GnomeDialog, this function
		sets parent of it to be the main app.
	* gui.c: in Message status menu, merged Untranslated and Translated
		into one toggle item :) Still no callbacks.
	* messages.h,parse.c: revised GtrMsgStatus. Now there are only three
		possible stati: translated, fuzzy, and stick, and they are
		flags, so message can be translated AND fuzzy.

2000-07-23  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* Too much changes to list. After all, I see no point in writing this
		file. Anyway, I have changed EVERYTHING here. Almost. Major
		changes and achievements follows:
	* gui.c: major revision. Moved all tool bar creation stuff to
		GnomeUIInfo structure, rearranged all menus and tool bars,
		simplified them, made them standard (stock), removed the
		duplicated find/search entries, changed message status menu to
		toggles/radio items. Created new "actions" framework for
		enabling/disabling of menu/tool bar entries. Works very well.
		Before you load a file you can't do much :) Removed lots of
		stuff from create_app1(), so it looks nice. Of course,
		goto_*_msg got changed *much*, now they change actions only
		if needed.
	* gui.h: respectively, changed this file. Removed all global variables,
		except app1, appbar1, text1, trans_box, and
		gtranslator_geometry. Added actions stuff.
	* header_stuff.[ch]: finally, made the edit_header dialog like others.
	* main.c: minor clean up, related to changes in gui.*. Removed the
		duplicated app1 variable.
	* parse.c: moved compile() function to here. Made Save button actually
		react to settings, so -- ask if to save unchanged files, or do
		not save at all. file_changed should be always in correct
		state now.

2000-07-23  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.c: Removed no_changes_dialog. Instead added to
	* parse.c: Added save_current_file (a callback for save), actual_write,
		no_reply_callback functions.
	* gui.c: added callbacks for Save.
	
2000-07-22  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* dialogs.*,../po/POTFILES.in,Makefile.am: renamed from gtr_dialogs.*
	* gui.c: moved get_*_msg, display_msg, update_msg, reached_*_msg,
		do_seach from parse.c to here, because they have nothing to do
		with parsing... renamed get_*_msg to goto_*_msg. removed the
		setting status in compile() when no file is opened. It should be
		disabled anyways. In clean_text_boxes() replaced everything with
		just two gtk_editable_delete_text(...) calls. Replaced
		gtk_text_get_length with -1 :)
		Removed View menu as it has no point.
	* dialogs.[ch]: added convenience functions raise_and_return_if_exists,
		which checks, whether a dialog exist, and if so, shows, raises
		it and returns. The variable should be global or static. At the
		end of dialog another function should be called:
		show_nice_dialog. Why nice? First, it shows the dialog. Next, it
		sets wmclass for it, and finally, an icon.
	* dialogs.c,about.c,prefs.c: according to above improvement, made almost
		all dialogs to use this. So, lots of code was removed and it
		looks nicer. Of course, all dialogs have icons, class, parents;
		may be created only once at a time, after closing they are
		destroyed, and raised if were just obscured.
	* prefs.*: moved widgets from prefs.h to prefs.c as they are not useful
		for anything outside this file. Replaced (gpointer)1 with
			GINT_TO_POINTER.
	* about.[ch]: left only one callback declared here -- about_box. Added
		myself to authors, I think I deserve it ;) Removed the "Now you
		can't see much..." from description, because it works quite
		well. well...
	* parse.c: removed the code which calls usleep. What the hell needs it.
		Instead I changed the status message so that we need only one.
		However, left it in configure.in...
	* *.h: removed lots of unused #include's.
	* TODO: added lots of ideas.

2000-07-21  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* gtr_dialogs.[ch]: further gnomefying of dialogs: goto. Related to
		this removal of all g_dlg* global variables and functions,
		leaving only one: goto_dlg, and a callback for it --
		goto_dlg_clicked. Also removed msg_pair_count variable.  GoTo
		dialog now displays current message number when shown.  Made
		*dialog widgets in these three functions static, connected
		signals to make them NULL when destroyed, and first check, if
		the dialog is already created -- then just show it.
	* gui.c: added some ...'s for menu entries, added goto menu entry,
		and callbacks for it, back and next, also changed
		disable/enable_buttons for this.

2000-07-21  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.[ch]: added functions: update_message, save_the_file,
		write_the_message, restore_msg, the latter being quite long.
		They implement writing messages to a file. update_message
		writes the text, if it was changed (a new variable
		message_changed), from trans_box to msgstr. This made
		gtranslator a real and useful application.
	* gtr_dialogs.[ch]: removed the unneeded global variables and lots of
		functions, related to save/open dialogs. There was crap...
		No made to function properly, save as now works. A "save as"
		copy of unchanged file is identically to the original.

2000-07-20  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>

	* Today I consider parsing to be finished. It works!
	* gtr_dialogs.c: replaced a bunch of gtk_widget_show with one
		gtk_widget_show_all, also made the dialog transient
		(g_dlg_create). Still need to do the same for other dialogs.
	* gtr_dialogs.c: corrected the Cancel button to destroy the goto dialog,
		and Go! button to actually work.
	* parse.c: added get_nth_msg for use in goto dialog and convenience
		function reached_middle_msg for enabling buttons. Also:
		added get_msg_status(gtr_msg *) for updating the message status
		with a very simple check. append_line(gchar **, gchar *),
		which formats the message enclosed in "'s and adds it to the
		first string. So messages are displayed nice... Almost.
		Fixed cleaning the boxes when text inside was edited.
		Completely rewrote the parse function, now I do not remember
		what was there before...
	* parse.h: according to parse.c, changed and reformatted the header...
	* gui.c: moved options button just before Exit, wrapped moving buttons
		with separators. Made text1 not editable (really in parse.c).

2000-07-18  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>
	
	* parse.[ch]: totally rewritten the parse() function -- now reads
		messages almost correctly (additional characters, something
		wrong with the line buffer). the header now is got as the first
		message pair, but ignored. Written reached_first_msg and
		reached_last_msg functions for changing the button status.
		Moved the stuff for displaying a message to display_msg
		function. Cleaned up get_****_msg due to above changes.
		Completely removed msg_pair variable, instead added cur_msg --
		a pointer to current message. Added get_msg_status function
		for getting and adjusting the translating status.
	* After all of these changes messages got displayed and
		first/prev/next/last buttons started to work! (What was a goal
		for 0.20, eh?)
	* Have read 64% of this file (till 200-05-24)... Uh...

2000-07-17  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@gtranslator.org>
	
	* changed all sprintf calls to GLib ones.
	* header_stuff.[ch]: written the get_header and free_header functions
	* parse.c: beginning to change parse() function to work properly
	* messages.h: some comments about places which need change
	* msg_db.c: free the msg_db string (close_msg_db)
	* gui.c: Replaced those crazy gtk_widget_show() with one call at the
		end... Also added a free_header(ph); call in gtranslator_quit

2000-07-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>
	
	* parse.c: Removed the one debug message and the
		corresponding ifdefs.
	
	* main.c: Call the intl-domain of POPT before showing
		the options.
		[ So we're now getting internationalized help
		   messages :) ]

2000-07-12  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* msg_db.c: Return a `0' not `NULL' if the challenge
		length cannot be send.
	
	* Makefile.am: Added these two files to the sources.
	
	* find.c & find.h: Added the files for the find routines.
	
	* main.c: Reformatted the comments and some blocks.
	
	* \*.c: Removed the last rests of these `//' C++
		comments in these C source files.

2000-07-07  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added the G_LOG_DOMAIN define for the build
		of gtranslator.

2000-07-06  Fatih Demir	 <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Use the existing static gtr_header and don't
		allocate, assign etc. the values and structures; don't
		 use these long if-trees.

	* gui.c: Bloat this menu with stock pixmaps.

	* gui.c: Extended the menus with a real messages status
		menu tree which represents the possible stati of
		 a message entry.
	
	* gui.c: Adding another menu-subtree from where you can
		define the msg_status field of every message.
		[ Only foo'ish for now .... ]
	
	* gtr_dialogs.c: Get the challenge-length from the Spinbutton
		for querying the messages db.
	
	* main.c: Corrected a typo at the `--challenge-length'
		option.

2000-07-04  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* gui.c: Disable the corresponding menu entries
		also if no file is open.
	
	* main.c: Added another option to specify the
		desired minimum match length ( aka.
 	 	 challenge length); perform a little
		  check before applying the default
		   challenge length;
		    set the default challenge length to 2.
	
	* msg_db.c: Two new routines which are setting the
		challenge length ( the length of the
		 strncasecmp-calls while retrieving the
 		  results for the query. ).
	
	* msg_db.h: Added the variable and the two prototypes for
		the new functions and the new variable.

2000-06-30  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Disabled the crashy assignment.
	
	* messages.h: Removed the abnormal status of a message;
		 added two pointers to the first and the
		  last message to the general po-file structure.

2000-06-27  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>
	
	* msg_db.c: Added the size returning function for
		the messages db handling.
	
	* header_stuff.c: Removed the free/malloc stuff from the
		header routines.

2000-06-14  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* .cvsignore: Removed dummy.po from the repo and from
		the .cvsignore.
	
	* header_stuff.c: Do the same again like weeks before,
		fill up the structure.

2000-06-12  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* header_stuff.c: Removed the ifdef for the header routines.
		started to work on `real'( TM ;) ) header routines.
		 get the message only then to the list if it's a
		  msg-block.
		   [ I love this font-shadowing from Eterm,
		     my CPU doesn't but that's another point.]
	
	* parse.c: Hmm, do some more widget work.

2000-06-11  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* parse.c: Take the string length of the temp_char
		as array length; ise two gchar's for the
		 operations (removed the "zamane" gchar.).

2000-06-10  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>
 
	* parse.c: Use a generally fresh allocated gchar for
		the parsing routines; corrected a typo.

        * main.c: Make the output of '-q' on the cmd-line
		look a bit better.

2000-06-10  Valek Filippov  <frob@df.ru>

	* gtr_dialogs.c:454  typo fixed.

2000-06-10  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>
	
	* EURO 2000 >)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)>)

	* Set the gtr_msg_status field according to
	
		the msgid; that's not the most perfect way
	
		to do it, but it seemed possible to me.

	* Use some voodoo to do the strip-off.

	* Rip the msgid and the msgstr clearly from
	
		the gchar.
	
		-> parse.c

	* Don't free the gchar as it's still used.
	
	* Made the mentioned gchar not allocated.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c

2000-06-09  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Highlight the main window during a drop.
	
		-> gui.c

	* Set the window properties and again use
	
		the window-icon if possible.
	
	* Adding the query dialog, the widgets
	
		and the according routines.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c/h

	* Yeah! The message db works now !
	
		[ forgot to remove the unneeded char-
	
		   length minorification. ]

		-> msg_db.c

	* Reverted the fake-signal to "activate".
	
		-> prefs.c

	* Moved main.c to the last place.
	
		-> Makefile.am

2000-06-08  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Also change the ifdef check to a check
	
		for GTR_GUI_H.
	
		-> gui.h

	* Moved interface.c/h to gui.c/h.
	
	* ------------------------------------

	* Changed all msg_db print age to message db
	
		as it should be from the beginning on.
	
		-> *.c
	
	* Changed the includes from all the files.
	
		-> *.h

	* Changed interface.c/h to gui.c/h.
	
	* Removed support.* really. They'ren't
	
		used by neither gtranslator nor from
	
		a function of gtranslator.
	
		-> Makefile.am
	
		-> support.*

	* Connect the signals, buttons and menu
	
		entries with each other.
	
		-> interface,c

	* Changed the field separator from
	
		';;;' to ';;'.
	
		-> msg_db.c

	* Use another gint to set the maximal
	
		message goto value.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c/h
	
	* Doing the two additional routines.
	
	* Fizzling with the msgid/str catching
	
		routines.
	
		-> parse.c

2000-06-06  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Added the forgotten ifdefs for the
	
		window-icon stuff.
	
		-> *.c

	* Made the comments to an ifdef.
	
	* Commented out all header stuff.
	
		-> header_stuff.c

	* Made the find dialog a little bit
	
		smaller.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c

	* Use g_strconcat rather than strcat.

	* Implemented the ( hopefully ) good
	
		methods for multi-line translations.

	* Removed the final gboolean; it has been
	
		replaced by three other gboolean which
	
		are also useful for the recognition of
	
		multi-line translations.

	* Do the same foo for the jump to the
	
		first string.
	
		-> parse.c

2000-06-05  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Removed an also unnecessary gchar.
	
		-> header_stuff.c

	* Do a little bit better checks while
	
		adding entries to the msg_db.

	* Removed an unneeded integer,
	
		-> msg_db.c

2000-06-04  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Added a msg-db menu with some entries.

	* Added a separator to the file menu.

	* Added some more menu entries to be in
	
		sync with the tool bar.

	* Connected the menu entries also with the
	
		new functions.
	
		-> interface.c

	* Include "gnome-window-icon.h" only if
	
		it's available on the system.
	
		-> interface.h
	
	* Removed all // GTR_* comments from the
	
		ifdefs as they'ren't ANSI-C conform.
	
		-> *.h

	* Hey, do only get (g_list_length-1)nth
	
		data.
	
	* Disable the corresponding button if we're
	
		at the first/last entry.

	* Implementing the button-callbacks as
	
		functions.

	* Reverted the recognition of the error-
	
		case.
	
	* Removed the ifdef, so we can now again
	
		watch gtranslator crashing...
	
		-> parse.c
	
	* Reverted to the old mechanism.
	
		-> header_stuff.c

	* Adjust the dialog size.

	* Create a table holding the widgets for the
	
		Find-dialog.
	
	* You can only "goto" till the last entry of
	
		the list, so carry it as an argument to the
	
		core-function.
	
	* Fill out the find dialogs.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c

	* Made some text-output non-translatable, e.g. the '\n''s.
	
		They'll be printed with another g_print, just to avoid
	
		more work for the translators.. ;)

	* Made the option working and restructured the init a
	
		bit.
	
	* Quit after the query before any GUI-element is loaded.
	
	* Print the query & the result.

	* Added a for-the-moment dummy option '-q' / '--query'
	
		which will be used to query the msg_db for entries
	
		without starting the whole GUI. Possibly ...
	
		-> main.c

2000-06-03  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Make first a check if it exists yet, and
	
		it it doesn't exist, print a message and open
	
		it with creation flags.

	* Create the msg_db, if necessary.
	
		-> msg_db.c

	* Set the window-icon in every popup-dialog.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c
	
		-> prefs.c

	* Don't free/alloc a temporary char.
	
		[ Avoids another crash. ]

	* Set the first element to '\0' in inp.
	
		-> header_stuff.c
	
	* Define and use the WINDOW_ICON defines.
	
		-> Makefile.am
	
	* Set the default window-icon.
	
		-> interface.c

	* Disable the msg-parsing for today.
	
	* Cat the strings, don't copy them.
	
		-> parse.c
	
2000-06-01  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>
	
	* The same for the header-routines.
	
		-> header_stuff.c

	* Recognized the most stupid error in

		the parse code.
	
	* Copy the strings, don't assign them!
	
		-> parse.c

2000-05-30  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Use a temporary gchar* as a bridging
	
		variable for the msg_db location.

	* Removed the "hard-coded" msg_db stuff.
	
		-> msg_db.c/h

	* Removed the MSG_DB definition as it's
	
		now made more practically with an option
	
		or in the user's dir.
	
		-> Makefile.am

	* Print out a string-based error message
	
		and not only the error number which isn't
	
		quite useful.
	
		-> parse.c

	* Set the widget sizes to be more nice, as we
	
		surely want to be able to read the mini-window
	
		titles without resizing.

	* Added a basic search dialog which is really
	
		poor in this state.
	
		-> gtr_dialogs.c/h

	* Show a little message before doing the quit.

	* Connected the additional signals for the
	
		find dialog.

	* Added another button to the search-bar; an
	
		`Add'-button which adds the current message
	
		pair to the msg_db.

	* Connect the corresponding function with the
	
		button.

	* Free the freshly allocated gchar's.

	* Added another function which is a callback
	
		function in between adding the entries to
	
		the msg_db and the corresponding button.
	
	* Close the msg_db on quit, if the msg_db has
	
		been inited/opened.
	
		-> interface.c

	* Check for the msg_db option and do some checks.

        +       Init the crappy-but-self-written
 
                msg_db-routines on startup.
 
                -> main.c

2000-05-28  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

        +       Freed the filenames list and added
 
                some comments.
 
                -> dnd.c

	* Hooked an accelerator to the web site
	
		menu-entry.
	
		-> interface.c

	* Made the edit_header_create()-function
	
		call a reference to the existing structure.

        +       Moved the check-button outside the table
 
                and into the vbox.

        +       Added a check-button which lets you use
 
                your personal options defined in the Preferences
 
                section to fill out the header.

	* Moved some variable declarations around.
	
	* Trying to get the header_stuff working.
	
	* Allocate the structure freshly via a
	
		new function.

		-> header_stuff.c/h

2000-05-26  Fatih Demir  <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* Added some other gint's which are
	
		holding the stored geometry definitions,
	
		if this is wished.
	
	* Read & write the geometry definitions.
	
		-> prefs.c/h

	* Set the geometry  from the prefs &
	
		the stored place.
	
	* Read the stored geometry devotions.

		-> main.c
	
	* Made the Gtk+ entry-boxes to GNOME
	
		entry-boxes and added a table holding
	
		all the nice entry-boxes and the labels.

	* Adding the first entry-boxes which
	
		are holding the parsed informations.
	
		-> header_stuff.c
	
	* Removed another crash reason; the check
