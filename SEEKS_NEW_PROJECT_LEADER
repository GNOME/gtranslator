Hi to all interested people out there!

As I can't handle gtranslator's future development, I'm seeking a new project leader for gtranslator who is willing to get gtranslator up to the GNOME 2.0 level and to develop it with the same pieces of love like I did for 2 years :-)

Any inquiries and/or questions please to me....
