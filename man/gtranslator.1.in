.SH NAME
gtranslator \-\- a translation supporting program for GNOME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gtranslator [ \-\-help ] [ \-\-version ] [ \-g geometry-string ] [ po-file ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
gtranslator aims to be a translation program for the GNOME project which will
surely have some more functions than now and will be working better than it does now. It ( will ) have got a message db function which will be extended to a typo of online word-book. You can't think of a translation for this word and you don't have got an idea how to deal it? simply look it up on a message db server in the Net which supports your language and holds the results of hard work contributed by you and the other translator of your language team. And with a mouse click you've got the word you were searching for. A good idea, or ?
