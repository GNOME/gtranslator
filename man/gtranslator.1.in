.SH NAME
gtranslator \-\- a translation supporting programm for GNOME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gtranslator [ \-\-help ] [ \-\-version ] [[ \-f ] po-file ] [[ \-q ] expression] [[ \-m ] msg-db ] [[ \-g ] geometry-string]

.SH DESCRIPTION
gtranslator aims to be a translation programm for the GNOME projects which will
surely have some more functions than now and will be working better than it does now. It ( will ) have got a message db function which will be extended to a typo of online word-book. You can't think of a translation for this word and you don't have got an idea how to deal it; simply look it up on a message db server in the Net which supports your language and holds the workds contributed by other persons with the same langauge like you. And with a mouse click you'Ve got the word you were searching for. A well idea, or ?

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-f \-\-file=po-file
Opens a po-file on the startup of gtranslator.
.TP
.I \-g \-\-geometry=geometry
Let's you specify the geometry of gtranslator's main window. An exaple would be :
gtranslator -g \*(lq320x200+0+0\*(rq -> gtranslator appears on the left-top edge and is 320x300 pixels big.
.TP
.I \-q \-\-query=query-string
Query the message db for a msgid. If this is on the startup gtranslator will query the message db without starting the GUI. The query is parsed case-INsensitive!
Again an example :
gtranslator --query=\*(lqOpen\*(rq -> queries the message db for 'Open'
.TP
.I \-m \-\-msg-db=msg-db
Let's you define the message db gtranslator should use as the message db for the actions you can do within gtranslator. Per default gtranslator creates a message db in ~/msg.db. With this option you can change this.
.TP
.I \-\-help
Shows you a little help autogenerated by GNOME and with the options mentioned above.
.TP
.I \-\-version
Prints out the version number of gtranslator.
.TP
.I \-\-usage
Shows you the pill of the options without an explanation.

.SH FILES
.B ~/msg.db
The default message db location ( created if not existent ).

.SH BUGS
gtranslator has got problems with the message parsing itself and this could be somehow solved but I'm working on it.
