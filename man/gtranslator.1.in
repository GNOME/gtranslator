.SH NAME
gtranslator \-\- a translation supporting programm for GNOME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gtranslator [ \-\-help ] [ \-\-version ] [ \-c challenge\-length ] [ \-f po-file ] [ \-q expression ] [ \-m msg-db ] [ \-g geometry-string ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
gtranslator aims to be a translation programm for the GNOME projects which will
surely have some more functions than now and will be working better than it does now. It ( will ) have got a message db function which will be extended to a typo of online word-book. You can't think of a translation for this word and you don't have got an idea how to deal it? simply look it up on a message db server in the Net which supports your language and holds the results of hard work contributed by you and the other translator of your language team. And with a mouse click you've got the word you were searching for. A good idea, or ?

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-c \-\-challenge\-length
Defines the minimum match length for the following query.
.TP
.I \-f \-\-file=po-file
Opens a po-file on the startup of gtranslator.
.TP
.I \-g \-\-geometry=geometry
Let's you specify the geometry of gtranslator's main window. 
.TP
.I \-q \-\-query=query\-string
Query the message db for a msgid. If this is on the startup gtranslator will query the message db without starting the GUI. The query is parsed case-_IN_sensitive and is only a simply catch-the-word-typo search routine.
.TP
.I \-m \-\-msg\-db=msg\-db
Let's you define the message db gtranslator should use as the message db for the actions you can do within gtranslator. Per default gtranslator creates a message db in ~/msg.db. With this option you can change this.
.TP
.I \-\-display
With this option you can select on which screen gtranslator should appear.
.TP
.I \-\-help
Shows you a little help autogenerated by GNOME and with the options mentioned above.
.TP
.I \-\-version
Prints out the version number of gtranslator.
.TP
.I \-\-usage
Shows you the pill of options without an explanation.

.SH FILES

.SH USAGE EXAMPLES
Some examples for the options.

.TP
.B gtranslator \-f tr.po
Opens the file \*(lqtr.po\*(rq on the startup.

.TP
.B gtranslator \-m /translation-project/words.base
Makes gtranslator use the \*(lq/translation-project/words.base\*(rq as the message db.
This file will be created if the file doesn't exist.

.TP
.B gtranslator \-q \*(lqOpen\*(rq
Queries gtranslator's message db ( you know per default this is \*(lq~/msg.db\*(rq) ) for the word \*(lqOpen\*(rq. The result will be displayed on the terminal and gtranslator answers the query without starting the GUI.

.TP
.B gtranslator \-c 3 \-q \*(lqOpe\*(rq
Performs a similar query as above but challenges the first 3 characters of the words while looking up a translation in the messages db.

.TP
.B gtranslator \-g \*(lq320x240+0+0\*(rq
Lets gtranslator appear on the leftern edge of the screen \*(lq+0+0\*(rq and gtranslator is
sized to \*(lq320x240\*(rq.
