.SH "NAME"
gtranslator \-\- a comfortable gettext po file editor with many features.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B gtranslator [ \-\-help ] [ \-\-version ] [ \-g geometry\-string  ] [ \-w html\-output\-file ] [ \-l po\-file\-to\-learn ] [ \-b ] [ \-n ] [ \-q query\-domains\-dir ] [ po\-file ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
gtranslator is a comfortable gettext po file editor with many features like special char featured editing, regular expression based search function, compile/update possiblities.
.TP 
Of course all standard features of a good application like DnD, session support and supplement files for mime types and menu items are present.
.TP 
Instant spell checking, excuberant syntax highlighting, comment view, views sidebar, a very comfortable messages table with customizable colors, colorschemes, a high level of preferences customizable and a personal learn buffer/translation memory feature with auto accomplishment functions are the main features of gtranslator.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
.I po\-file
A po\-file to open at the startup of gtranslator.
.TP 
.I \-g \-\-geometry=geometry
Let's you specify the geometry of gtranslator's main window.
.TP 
.I \-w \-\-webalize=html\-output\-file po\-file
Creates a given html file output which is an htmlized and syntax highlighted version of the po\-file.
Especially good for webpages and other nice sites.
.TP 
.I \-b \-\-build\-informations
Shows the build specifications (date, time, versions, directories) of gtranslator.
.TP 
.I \-n \-\-no\-modules
Inhibit the loading of any backend modules.
.TP 
.I \-l \-\-learn=po\-file\-to\-learn
Learns the given po file within the command line without starting the GUI. The personal learn buffer is used as a translation memory to autoaccomplish missing translations/entries.
.TP 
.I \-q \-\-querydomaindir=query\-domains\-dir
Changes the standard locales directory where gtranslator looks for the available query domains (per default: @prefix@/share/locale).
.TP 
.I \-\-display
With this option you can select on which screen gtranslator should appear.
.TP 
.I \-\-help
Shows you a little help autogenerated by GNOME and with the options mentioned above.
.TP 
.I \-\-version
Prints out the version number of gtranslator.
.TP 
.I \-\-usage
Shows you the pill of options without an explanation.

.SH "FILES"
.B ~/.gnome/gtranslator
.TP 
.B ~/.gconf/apps/gtranslator
.TP 
Your personal gtranslator settings will be stored there (if compiled with GConf support, you'll find it in ~/.gconf/apps/gtranslator/, if not in ~/.gnome/gtranslator).
.TP 
.B ~/.gtranslator
This directory is used by gtranslator for all it's "private" files (e.g. temporary files).
.TP 
.B ~/.gtranslator/colorschemes/
Your personal colorschemes can be placed in this directory \-\- gtranslator does also list the colorschemes in this directory in the colorscheme selection box.
.TP 
.B ~/.gtranslator/etstates/
The state file for the messages table/tree is stored in this directory.
.TP 
.B ~/.gtranslator/umtf/learn\-buffer.xml
Your personal learn buffer (in UMTF format) is stored in this file \-\- it's used for learning and autoaccomplishing.
.SH "LEARN BUFFER"
The learn buffer is the implementation of a personal translation memory (TM) in gtranslator. gtranslator uses the human\-readable \fBUMTF\fR XML format for storing it's learned strings.
.br 
Your learned strings are then available for the autoaccomplishment feature of gtranslator where gtranslator automatically fills in the corresponding and valuable translations for any message which has already been learned previously. This results in a fairly high percentage of prefilled/pretranslated messages.
.br 
The common and good style of working with the learn buffer and with the autoaccomplishment should be to learn the main po/translation files for your language via gtranslator via calling \fBgtranslator \-n \-l po\-file\-to\-learn\fR on the command line; this will put the translated strings from this po file into your personal learn buffer.
.br 
You should learn the main po files (for GNOME for example \fBgnumeric\fR, \fBnautilus\fR, \fBevolution\fR or any other bigger, already translated package's po file) for your language).
.br 
Afterwards you can simply use the "Autoaccomplishment" menu entry from the GUI or use the "F10" hotkey to let gtranslator autoaccomplish all missing translations from your personal learn buffer. This will ease your translation work and make a big portion of the po files be pre\-translated.
.br 
With a fairly big personal learn buffer of about 2 MB you can achive many pre\-translated messages for a new project/translation.
.SH "USAGE EXAMPLES"
Some examples for the options.

.TP 
.B gtranslator \-b
Shows you the real build specs/dates of gtranslator.

.TP 
.B gtranslator \-n \-l po\-file\-to\-learn
Learns the given po file \*(lqpo\-file\-to\-learn\*(rq on the command line without starting up the GUI \-\- modules aren't loaded, too (makes startup a bit faster).

.TP 
.B gtranslator tr.po
Opens the file \*(lqtr.po\*(rq on the startup.

.TP 
.B gtranslator \-w Evolution.html po/tr.po
Opens the \*(lqpo/tr.po\*(rq po file and creates a html output file in \*(lqEvolution.html\*(rq.

.TP 
.B gtranslator file://tmp/mypo.po
Opens \*(lq/tmp/mypo.po\*(rq file (as you can see gtranslator now supports local URIs).

.TP 
.B gtranslator http://www.remotehost.org/testpo.po
\*(lqOpens\*(rq the remote po file (right: gtranslator does also support remote GnomeVFS supported URIs).

.TP 
.B gtranslator \-g \*(lq460x320+0+0\*(rq
Lets gtranslator appear on the left upper edge of the screen \*(lq+0+0\*(rq and gtranslator is
sized to \*(lq460x320\*(rq if possible \-\- if gtranslator needs more size for it's window contents, it'll expand itself to the necessary dimensions \-\- even if you defined a smaller geometry string.
