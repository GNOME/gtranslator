.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B gtranslator [ PO-FILE ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
gtranslator is a comfortable gettext po file editor with many features like special char featured editing, plural forms view, div. charset support, comfortable prefs, list view of messages, regular expression based search function, compile/update possibilities and much much more.

.TP 
Of course all standard features of a good application like DnD, session support, supplement files for mime types and menu items are present.

.TP 
Instant comment view, a comfortable quick navigation messages table with customizable colors, colorschemes, UTF\-8 support, a high level of preferizabilation and a personal learn buffer/translation memory with autotranslation capabilities are the main features of gtranslator besides the comfortable editing of the translation entries.

.SH "LEARN BUFFER"
The learn buffer is the implementation of a personal translation memory (TM) in gtranslator. gtranslator uses the \fBUMTF\fR (a compressed XML file which is normally quite good human readable if uncompressed) format for storing its learned strings.
.br 
Your learned strings are then available for the autotranslation feature of gtranslator where gtranslator automatically fills in the corresponding and valuable translations for any message which has already been learned previously. This results in a fairly high percentage of prefilled/pretranslated messages.
.br 
The common and good style of working with the learn buffer and with the autotranslation should be to learn the main po/translation files for your language.
.br 
You should learn the main po files (for GNOME for example \fBgnumeric\fR, \fBnautilus\fR, \fBevolution\fR or any other bigger, already translated package's po file) for your language); you can use a new script from the gtranslator package to automatise this task a little bit: it's \*(lqbuild-gtranslator-learn-buffer.sh\*(rq which is installed into gtranslator's scripts directory which you can see by calling \fBgtranslator \-b\fR and you simply execute the script with its full path and simply follow the information on the command line for it.
.br 
Afterwards you can simply use the "Autotranslation" menu entry from the GUI or use the "F10" hotkey to let gtranslator autotranslate all missing translations from your personal learn buffer. This will ease your translation work and make a big portion of the po files be pre\-translated.
.br 
With a fairly big personal learn buffer of about 2 MB you can achieve many pre\-translated messages for a new project/translation.
.br 
If you want to use the stored learn buffer contents to produce a po file with all the \*(lqlearned\*(rq translations, you can also use the \*(lqexport learn buffer\*(rq capability of gtranslator to get a plain po file version of the learn buffer.
