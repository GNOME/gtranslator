gtranslator README R 0.35
-------------------------

gtranslator is a comfortable gettext po/po.gz/(g)mo files editor for the
 GNOME project with many features.

If you've got this from CVS , you've got to read the INSTALL.CVS
 file in order to get the ./configure script etc.

This is the HEAD part of gtranslator and will show you the future of
 gtranslator which will surely include very soon some nice features like
  they're mentioned in the TODO file.
 
As gtranslator is fairly quick changing you'd also have a look at the webpage:
