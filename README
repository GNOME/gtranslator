gtranslator README R 0.39
-------------------------

gtranslator is a comfortable gettext po/po.gz/(g)mo files editor for the
 GNOME project with many features. It's evolving quite fast and many
  useful functions are already implemented.

The nautilus-gtranslator-view is for now a small try to get a useful view
 for nautilus and i18n -- it will be more useful and stable in future -- so
  that you can even try it in nowadays.

If you've got this from CVS , you've got to read the INSTALL.CVS
 file in order to get the ./configure script etc.

As gtranslator is fairly quick changing you'd also have a look at the webpage:
 
	http://www.gtranslator.org

In the case you found a bug or wanted to give us a "wish-feature" of your own
 you can contact Bugzilla at:
