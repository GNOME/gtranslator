gtranslator README R 0.40
-------------------------

gtranslator is a translation-supporting program for the GNOME project.

It is offering little functionality yet but it will be more useful
 and complex later on.

If you've got this from CVS , you've got to read the INSTALL.CVS
 file in order to get the ./configure script etc.

This is the HEAD part of gtranslator and will show you the future of
 gtranslator which will surely include very soon some nice features like
  they're mentioned in the TODO file.
 
As gtranslator is fairly quick changing you'd also have a look at the webpage:
