gtranslator README R 0.32
-------------------------

gtranslator is a translation-supporting program for the Gnome project.
It is offering little functionality yet but it will be more useful
and complex later on.

If you've got this from CVS , you've got to read the INSTALL.CVS
file in order to get the ./configure script etc.

On problems with the preferences and crashes within the property-box
you've got probably the "crashy" series of GConf 0.9 installed. In
further CVS development and R 0.10 all problems have been removed.
If you've got these "crashy" series of GConf you'd probably try to
configure gtranslator again with the environment variable $NO_GCONF
set to yes. This will prevent (lib-)gtranslator to be linked against
GConf even it it's found. For bash you've got to do simply this:
$ export NO_GCONF=yes
$ ./configure ALL_YOUR_NASTY_AND_DESIRED_OPTIONS

If you're using RPM packages of (lib-)gtranslator you can be happy :)
These aren't linked against GConf yet, so you don't have got these
problems.
	
After some direction changes, we're cruising towards a libgtranslator
which supplies all the important functions and a gtranslatord daemon
which replies to any requests and queries from the gtranslator client
program. This will be the future and I think this will take a long
time to work, but if we're writing a translation framework for GNOME,
then it should be something really good.

The version number doesn't show anything till you'll see a magical 
"1.0" in the about dialog of gtranslator or in the configure-script.

The releases 0.3x and coming releases are now usable and working but
are missing some important parts of the capabilities which gtranslator
will offer later on. So stand by and visit the gtranslator home page
on the web from time to time:
