gtranslator README
------------------

gtranslator is a comfortable gettext po/po.gz/(g)mo files editor for the
 GNOME project with many features. It's evolving quite fast and many
  useful functions are already implemented; gtranslator aims to be a
   very complete editing environment for translation issues within the
    GNU gettext/GNOME desktop world.

If you've got this from CVS, you've got to read the INSTALL.CVS file in
 to get the usual build files (for example the "./configure" script etc.).

As gtranslator is fairly quick changing you'd also have a look at the webpage:
 
	http://www.gtranslator.org

and: you can add gtranslator news to your Nautilus news sidebar per adding
 this RSS file to your news sources list:

	http://www.gtranslator.org/news.rss

In the case you found a bug or wanted to give us a "wish-feature" of your own
 you can contact Bugzilla at:

 	http://bugzilla.gnome.org

If you have got any problems, need support, want to give any ideas, hints, blame
 us, spam us or declare your love to gtranslator you can do this via the
  gtranslator-devel mailing on sourceforge.net; you can register via:

  	http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gtranslator-devel

BTW, the mailing list is quite active in the last time (months...) :-)	

The new main developer of gtranslator is now Ross Golder <ross@golder.org> and
 he has got a very good deal in porting gtranslator to GNOME 2.x so that we're
  now also in the same platform stage as the rest of the GNOME desktop.

Please don't hesitate to file bug reports on http://bugzilla.gnome.org or to
 share your comments, ideas, suggestions with us on our mailing list - we do
  really, really, really appreciate any kind of feedback and user comments
   very much in the community/gtranslator field :-)
