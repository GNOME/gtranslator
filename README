	gtranslator is a translation-supporting programm for the Gnome project.
	It is offering little funtionability yet but it will be more useful
	and complex later on.
	
	If you've got this from CVS , you've got to read the INSTALL.CVS
	file in order to get the ./configure script etc.
	
	After some direction changes, we're cruising towards a libgtranslator
	which supplies all the important functions and a gtranslatord daemon
	which replies to any requests and queries from the gtranslator client
	programm. This will be the future and I think this will take a long
	time to work, but if we're writing a translation for GNOME, then it
	should be something really good.

	The version number doesn't show anything till you'll see a magical 
	"1.0" in the about dialog of gtranslator or in the configure-script.

	The releases 0.21 and coming releases are now usable and working but
	are missing some important parts of the capabilities which gtranslator
	will offer later on. So stand by and visit the gtranslator homepage
	on the web from time to time:
