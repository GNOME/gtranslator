gtranslator README R 0.35
-------------------------

gtranslator is a comfortable gettext po/po.gz/(g)mo files editor for the
 GNOME project with many features.

If you've got this from CVS , you've got to read the INSTALL.CVS
 file in order to get the ./configure script etc.

As gtranslator is fairly quick changing you'd also have a look at the webpage:
