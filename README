gtranslator README
------------------

gtranslator is a comfortable gettext po/po.gz/(g)mo files editor for the
 GNOME project with many features. It's evolving quite fast and many
  useful functions are already implemented; gtranslator aims to be a
   very complete editing environment for translation issues within the
    GNU gettext/intltools world.

If you've got this from CVS, you've got to read the INSTALL.CVS file in
 to get the usual build files (for example the "./configure" script etc.).

As gtranslator is fairly quick changing you'd also have a look at the webpage:
 
	http://www.gtranslator.org

and: you can add gtranslator news to your Nautilus news sidebar per adding
 this RSS file to your news sources list:

	http://www.gtranslator.org/news.rss

In the case you found a bug or wanted to give us a "wish-feature" of your own
 you can contact Bugzilla at:

 	http://bugzilla.gnome.org

If you have got any problems, need support, want to give any ideas, hints, blame
 us, spam us or declare your love to gtranslator you can do this via the
  gtranslator-devel mailing on sourceforge.net; you can register via:

  	http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gtranslator-devel

You can mail directly to "gtranslator-devel@lists.sourceforge.net" -- it's an
 open mailing list, so that you can also port as a non-member to it; please
  say in this case that you need to get CC'ed answers as you're not a member of
   the list -- else you need to visit the archives to see the replies to your 
    message -- you surely don't want to do this.
