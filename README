gtranslator R 0.15: 
`-----------------'

	gtranslator will be a translation-supporting programm for the Gnome
	project . It is offering little funtionability yet but it will be 
	more expandable later on . 
	
	For these days/weeks I'll put gtranslator to work with libdyndata ,
	so I'll get some of the well-missed STL-Funcs of C++ into C .

	The DB-functionability will be something which will base upon plain
	text files which will be organized as binary trees ( ->libdyndata )
	and will be gzipped at the end & gunzipped before starting to work. 
				       		
	Have a look at it and you'll see that it isn't/couldn't be finished 
	or really satisfying till this moment .
 
	If you want to have a usable version wait till R 0.2 , I think till 
	this version it should be ready-to-use .
