gtranslator (-the GNOME 2.x translation making program-) README
---------------------------------------------------------------

gtranslator is a quite comfortable gettext po/po.gz/(g)mo files editor for the
 GNOME 2.x platform with many features. It's evolving quite fast and many
  useful functions are already implemented; gtranslator aims to be a
   very complete editing environment for translation issues within the
    GNU gettext/GNOME desktop world.

As gtranslator is fairly quick changing you'd also have a look at the webpage:
 
	http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net

In the case you found a bug or wanted to give us a "wish-feature" of your own
 you can contact Bugzilla at:

 	http://bugzilla.gnome.org

If you have got any problems, need support, want to give any ideas, hints, blame
 us, spam us or declare your love to gtranslator you can do this via the
  gtranslator-list mailing on GNOME; you can register via:

  	http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gtranslator-list

Please don't hesitate to file bug reports on http://bugzilla.gnome.org or to
 share your comments, ideas, suggestions with us on our mailing list - we do
  really, really, really appreciate any kind of feedback and user comments
   very much in the community/gtranslator field :-)
