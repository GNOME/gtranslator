gtranslator README R 0.32
-------------------------

gtranslator is a translation-supporting programm for the Gnome project.
It is offering little funtionability yet but it will be more useful
and complex later on.

If you've got this from CVS , you've got to read the INSTALL.CVS
file in order to get the ./configure script etc.

On problems with the preferences and crashs within the propertybox
you've got probably the "crashy" series of GConf 0.9 installed. In
further CVS development and R 0.10 all problems have been removed.
If you've got these "crashy" series of GConf you'd probably try to
configure gtranslator again with the environment variable $NO_GCONF
set to yes. This will prevent (lib-)gtranslator to be linked against
GConf even it it's found. For bash you've got to do simply this:
$ export NO_GCONF=yes
$ ./configure ALL_YOUR_NASTY_AND_DESIRED_OPTIONS

If you're using RPM packages of (lib-)gtranslator you can be happy :)
These aren't linked against GConf yet, so you don't have got these
problems.
	
After some direction changes, we're cruising towards a libgtranslator
which supplies all the important functions and a gtranslatord daemon
which replies to any requests and queries from the gtranslator client
programm. This will be the future and I think this will take a long
time to work, but if we're writing a translation for GNOME, then it
should be something really good.

The version number doesn't show anything till you'll see a magical 
"1.0" in the about dialog of gtranslator or in the configure-script.

The releases 0.21 and coming releases are now usable and working but
are missing some important parts of the capabilities which gtranslator
will offer later on. So stand by and visit the gtranslator homepage
on the web from time to time:
