### gtranslator README R 0.15
###############################################################################
	gtranslator will be a translation-supporting programm for the Gnome
	project . It is offering little funtionability yet but it will be 
	more expandable later on . 
	
	For these days/weeks I'll put gtranslator to work with libdyndata ,
	so I'll get some of the well-missed STL-Funcs of C++ into C .

	The DB-functionability will be something which will base upon plain
	text files which will be organized as binary trees ( ->libdyndata )
	and will be gzipped at the end & gunzipped before starting to work.

	If you haven't got the libdyndata yet, get it from the gtransator-
	page for libdyndata :

		http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net/dyndata.html
				       		
	If you've got this from CVS , you've got to read the INSTALL.CVS
	file .
	
	Have a look at it and you'll see that it isn't/couldn't be finished 
	or really satisfying till this moment .
 
	If you want to have a usable version wait till R 0.2(0) , I think till 
	this version it should be ready-to-use .
