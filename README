gtranslator README
-------------------------

gtranslator is a comfortable gettext po/po.gz/(g)mo files editor for the
 GNOME project with many features. It's evolving quite fast and many
  useful functions are already implemented; gtranslator aims to be a
   very complete editing environment for translation issues within the
    GNU gettext/xml-i18n-tools world.

If you've got this from CVS , you've got to read the INSTALL.CVS file in
 to get the usual build files (for example the "./configure" script etc.).

As gtranslator is fairly quick changing you'd also have a look at the webpage:
 
	http://www.gtranslator.org

and: you can add gtranslator news to your Nautilus news sidebar per adding
 this RSS file to your news sources list:

	http://www.gtranslator.org/news.rss

In the case you found a bug or wanted to give us a "wish-feature" of your own
 you can contact Bugzilla at:
