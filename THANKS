Thanks to:
---------

- All translators of this package (I know it's hard to understand what
   I do write in source code...)
- The msgid-QE Christian Rose <menthos@menthos.com>
- Denis Pleic' <dpleic@linux.hr> for his pointer to TMX <grin/>.
- Andrea Rizzi with her KTranslator which made me want to write a better
 	program like this for GNOME as I love GNOME ...

Patches, contributions and requests:

- Josh Jackson <pturing@mailandnews.com>
- Alexandre Hautequest <hquest@fesppr.br>

And to the world of GNOME, but especially:
-----------------------------------------

- The GNOME I18N list <gnome-i18n@gnome.org> for the help with the
	languages and their writing, the encodings, the language/translation
	 groups, their email addresses and many things more.
