Gtranslator is an enhanced gettext po file editor for the GNOME desktop
environment. It handles all forms of gettext po files and includes very useful
features like find/replace, translation memory, different translator profiles,
messages table (for having an overview of the translations/messages in the po
file), easy navigation and editing of translation messages and comments of the
translation where accurate.

## How to build

If you get this code from the git repository the easier way to build is using
gnome-builder. There's a flatpak manifest that gnome-builder uses to build all
deps and launch the application sandboxed so you don't need to worry about
dependencies.

If you want to build by hand, you should follow the meson build commands:

```
meson _build
ninja -C _build
ninja -C _build install
```

## Translations

Helping to translate Gtranslator or add support to a new language is very
