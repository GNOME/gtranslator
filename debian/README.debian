gtranslator for Debian
----------------------

This is the try to reanimate the Debian packages of gtranslator within the current
development trace so that I'm doing Debian packages by myself in here for Debian
unstable. You can try it but should surely wait for an official version of the
Debian packages appearing on your apt-get source of choice :-)
