2001-01-02  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* vfs-handle.c: Use plain old libgnome g_file_exists function
		for determining if the needed temporary directory is
		 already existent; free one of the used gchars.

2001-01-31  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* vfs-handle.c: Hide all the parts of the URI within the
		transition into a filename string; removed some
		 unneeded structures.

2001-01-24  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* \*.c/.h: Extended the development years also to
		2001.

2001-01-13  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Also include the vfs-handle.c in a dist.

2001-01-07  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* libgtranslator.h, Makefile.am: Removed the local own
		implementation of the recent files stuff.
	
	* recent-files.c/.h: Removed these files.

2001-01-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* ChangeLog: Applied an aspell spell check on
		this file.

	* recent-files.c: Corrected some small errors.

	* vfs-handle.c/.h: Reworked the GnomeVFS routine
		to return the transferred local file's name.
	
2001-01-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* recent-files.c: Corrected more stupidness.

2000-12-31  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* recent-files.c/.h: Added all necessary functions.

	* \*.\*: Reformatted and reworked almost all comments
		and removed some unnecessary comments.

	* vfs-handle.c/.h: Reformatted the files and added a
		FIXME.

	* \*.h: Changed the header directives to the prefixed
		LIBGTRANSLATOR_DIRECTIVE version (e.g.:
		 VFS_HANDLE_H -> LIBGTRANSLATOR_VFS_HANDLE_H).

	* libgtranslator.h: Include the new recent-files.h header.

	* Makefile.am: Added the new source files to the build.

	* recent-files.c/.h: Added own recent files code.

2000-12-30  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* main.c: Include "../config.h" and re enable the gettext-binding
		functions' call.

2000-12-30  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* stylistics.c: great optimization/leak hunting/optimization on string
	operations in gtranslator_color_values_get/set. No functionality
	changed. just made "colors/bg_red" instead of "colors/bg/red" --
	gnome-config does not handle such paths.

2000-12-09  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* main.c: The gettext actions "bindtextdomain" and "textdomain"
		are resulting in an error "statement with no effect";
		 grr, this is now commented out...

	* Makefile.am: Got the USE_VFS_STUFF define to the CFLAGS
		while compiling...

	* libgtranslator.h: Removed the config.h stuff -- this isn't
		a global thing, so it shouldn't be in the global header --
		 or are we installing a config.h also to ${prefix} ? No.
	
2000-12-07  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* *.h: changed #include <libgtranslator/...> to #include "..."
	* libgtranslator.h: #include <config.h>. Now it compiles again!

2000-12-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Added conditionally compilation of the new
		vfs-handle.c source (it's only integrated if GnomeVFS
		 is present).

	* vfs-handle.c/.h: Added GnomeVFS based remote file-methods.

2000-11-18  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse-db.c: Changed the macro calls accordingly.

	* translation-database.h: Changed the structure for UMTF,
		renamed some macros and put some more comments into it.

2000-11-13  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* parse-db.c: create db->header and not segfault. Use g_strdup_printf
	and not fixed size buffer. First assign value and then print it, not
	again egt it from XML document. Do not copy list (do we need memory
	leaks?)
	* preferences.c: interchange places of includes, so that
	"name space cleanup" is not needed. Simplify private_path printing and
	free it after use. Replaced all translatable error stuff with simple
	g_return_if_fail(). Why be so verbose? In gtranslator_config_get_*
	return values after #endif, so that we can do something (free). Removed
	config_init and config_close from every function. Use our routines to
	*et_last_run_date (is it useful anyway?). Increased size of date buffer
	in set_last_run_date function -- localized it can be larger.

2000-11-12  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* libgtranslator.h: Removed the 
		gtranslator-preferences-dialog.h include.

	* Makefile.am, gtranslator-preferences-dialog.*:
		Removed these preferences files from the
		 sources and from the build.

2000-11-08  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Added gtkled.* to the sources
		and headers.

2000-11-07  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* libgtranslator.h: Added gtkled.h to the
		headers.

	* gtkled.c/h: Added the GtkLed widget sources
		to libgtranslator.

2000-11-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* team-handle.c: Use the MAXPATHLEN specifier
		for the filename length, as this is now
		 a gchar array; removed thr stupid check
		  for node, which causes even then a crash,
		   when it worked...

	* gtranslator-preferences-dialog.c/h: Changed the
		title argument to be a gchar pointer and not
		 a const gchar pointer.

	* gtranslator-preferences-dialog.h: Removed the
		buttons from the GtranslatorPreferencesDialog
		 as we do use now the GNOME_STOCK_BUTTON_...
		  for this.
	
	* gtranslator-preferences-dialog.c: Removed some
		variables, build up a GnomeDialog, put a
		 GtkVPaned into it and place the index and
		  section widgets into the vbox of the
		   GnomeDialog.

2000-10-31  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* team-database.h: Removed the macros as they'ren't
		very useful as it seemed at the first
		 glance.

	* team-handle.c/h: The parsing routines for an
		existing team database are written now with
		 a very perfect line length (sorry, a half
		  screen vim window is too nice at 1024x768).

	* handle-db.c: Also handle the multiple msgstr case
		with the help of the new macros; the
		 msgstrlist is now also parsed for "matches"
		  and there's now a skeleton for looking up
		   a word in the database and returning any
		    GtrMsg entry matching this query in a new
		     GList.
		 Also added a lookup function which _could_ be
		  useful for searching matching entries to a
		   msgid in the database.

	* translation-database.h: Added two monster macros for
		the handling of the GtrMsgs in the list (even
		 the macros are really monstrous big!).

	* team-handle.c/h: "Flushed" these files for the new
		functions in use for the team-handling functions;
		 added a new function which opens the team database.

	* handle-db.c/h: Added a gtranslator_delete_from_db
		function which removes the given GtrMsg from
		 the database, added two encapsulating functions
		  for the msgid/msgstr removal from the database;
		   unfortunately the remove function doesn't handle
		    the the possible "msgstrlist" of the GtrMsgs'.
		 Also allocate the used GtranslatorDatabase freshly
		  via g_new0 to avoid an uninitialized error.

2000-10-30  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* handle-db.c: Implemented multiple msgstrs' write
		in the message database, wrote the corresponding
		 gtranslator_open_db function (also tested it,
		  it works ;-) ) and added a gtranslator_add_to_db
		   function which adds a given MsgStr or parts
		    of it at appliance to the database.

	* parse-db.c: Copy the GList via g_list_copy instead
		of assigning it simply, and copy the strings
		 via g_strdup to avoid programmers' best friends:
		  crashes.

	* gtranslator-preferences.c/h: Did also apply Gtk+-
		conform structure building and _no_ pointer
		 usage in structure definition.
	
	* team-database.h: Applied the same policy here.

	* main.c: Only include the main header and not three
		"sub-headers".

	* Makefile.am: Added the new team-database.h header
		to the includes list.
	
	* libgtranslator.h: Include the new team-database.h
		header.
	
	* team-database.h: Added the header containing the 
		team structures for use with the team 
		 management and coordination routines.
	
	* team-handle.c/h: Removed the unused "list" variable
		and the lookup_in_doc function; this should be
		 solved in another way.
	
2000-10-30  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* handle-db.h, main.c, parse-db.*, translation-database.h:
		Made GtranslatorDatabase and -Header normal structures, 
		not pointer, for consistency with gtk style.
	* parse-db.c: initialize db and messages variables in
		parse_db_for_lang.
	
2000-10-29  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* handle-db.c: Include <unistd.h> for the unlink
		function.

	* handle-db.c/h: Added a dump function which stores
		the given database under another filename,
		 also added a define for this new function
		  which takes the much more logical name
		   gtranslator_copy_db and added the new
		    gtranslator_move_db function which
		     does already use this new function.

	* messages.h: Added a msgstrlist field which is
		a list of possible translations for a msgid,
		 so you guessed it right, this is a feature for
		  the message database features.

	* handle-db.c/h: Wrote the gtranslator_dave_db
		function which stores the given database
		 to the disc.

	* stylistics.c/.h: The gtranslator_set_style
		function now takes only one widget as
		 an argument, not two like in previous
		  times.
		Do use gushorts and the gnome_color..i16
		 methods to set/get the color values to avoid
		  rounding errors; also changed the edited
		   gtranslator_set_style method to get/set
		    integer values as we're now string int's
		     and no longer gfloats.

	* parse-db.c: Use the new macros and a FIXME is now
		also included in this file as it does always
		 _crash_ gtranslatord trying to parse a message
		  database at the line 55.

	* translation-database.h: Added some crappy
		macros for less typing ( :-) ) and made
		 the filename again a normal gchar.
	
2000-10-28  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Added gtranslatord.h and the new
		libgtranslator.h headers to the include
		 list of libgtranslator.
	
	* libgtranslator.h: A central header for
		libgtranslator which includes all the other
		 headers of libgtranslator (like gnome.h
		  for libgnome/libgnomeui).

	* handle-db.c/h: Added the new gtranslator_save_db
		function which is for now also a skeleton.

	* translation-database.h: Made the filename
		part of the structure use a gchar array
		 and removed the static database declaration.

	* main.c: Removed the pars_db_save function call
		as this function is now removed; also
		 removed the option for this previous
		  function call and the corresponding
		   static gchar variable.

	* parse-db.c/.h: Removed the parse_db_save function
		as it hasn't got to do anything with
		 the parsing of the message database.

	* handle-db.c/.h: Removed the one and lonely
		function previously stored here;
		 this file will include the generally
		  used and important functions for
		   the message database handling.

	* gtranslator-preferences-dialog.c: Made the
		default header title translatable,
		 added more parts of the creation
		  dialog( the pane, clist etc.).

	* *.h/.c: Removed one line from the start
		notice.
	
	* messages.h: Made the header also according to
		the rest of libgtranslator :-)

2000-10-25  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Also define the G_LOG_DOMAIN as
		"libgtranslator", include the new
		  translation-database.h file in the
		   includes and reorder the files
		    alphabetically.
	
	* translation-database.h: Added a new header file
		which will store the structure data of
		 a translation/message database.

	* parse-db.c/.h: Added the corresponding save
		function for the message db ( more
		 honest: for the list of messages );
		  it's filled up with some fix-values
		   for now, as it's not in use and that
		    piece of sources are only for testing.
 
        * main.c: Introduce options and handling of the
                --parse-db/-p option to parse the given
                 message database, also changed the given
		  textdomain directory to GNOMELOCALEDIR;
		   undef and redefine the G_LOG_DOMAIN.

        * parse-db.*: Removed the checking routine which is
                obsolete as the other functions do also
                 perform checks; don't print out the node
                  list.

        * handle-db.*: Removed the filename argument from
                the call of gtranslator_add_node_to_doc.
 
        * Makefile.am: Removed foo.xml from the dist files and
                added the messages.h file to libgtranslator;
                 that's outsourcing! Also define the new
		  GNOMELOCALEDIR define like in the src-dir,
		   so that we'd also get now gettextized
		    messages for libgtranslator/gtranslatord.

	* foo.xml: Removed it as it's useless for us :-)

        * messages.h: Moved the messages.h from the ./src-dir
                to libgtranslator.

        * *.c/*.h: Use absolute includes for the libgtranslator
                headers, e.g. <libgtranslator/preferences.h>
                 instead of <preferences.h>.
 
        * parse-db.h: Removed the <messages.h> include as the
                content of this file isn't used yet in any
                 routine of libgtranslator ( and it shouldn't
                  do that as long as messages.h belongs to
                   gtranslator; possibly this file should be
                    moved to libgtranslator ).

	* gtranslator-preferences-dialog.c: Added the first
		function skeleton for the dialog-creating
		 function.

	* gtranslator-preferences-dialog.h: Added many prototypes
		and macros for the coming function in this new
		 "GtranslatorPreferencesDialog" widget.

2000-10-23  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Some Makefile-stuff for getting the sources
		to build without manual intervention and included
		 the new files in the sources and in the include
		  targets.

	* gtranslator-preferences-dialog.c/.h: The new files for an
		own and more intelligent preferences dialog.

2000-10-16  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

        * preferences.c: Corrected a typo in a comment :-) Also
                remove the "/apps/gtranslator" directory from the
                 GConf client when closing down the preferences
                  stuff.

2000-10-15  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* stylistics.c/h: Put the gtranslator_set_style function
		here; it's good for manipulating two widgets'
		 style options ( preferably for the two text
		  boxes of gtranslator ).

	* Makefile.am: Removed test-libgtranslator/test-lg.c
		from the sources and targets.
	
	* test-lg.c: Removed it due to uselessness.

	* stylistics.c: Added the routines and sources for the
		color storing/getting functions.

	* stylistics.h: Added this header which controls all the
		color based stuff within libgtranslator and added
		 an enumeration which defines what to store.

	* Makefile.am: Added the new "stylistics.c/h" files
		to the sources and headers list.

	* preferences.h: Added the gfloat setting/getting
		routines.
	
	* preferences.c: Corrected some wrong stuff within the date
		storing/getting routines, added the gfloat get/set-
		 methods and added defines to wrap the doubles into
		  the gfloat routines.

2000-10-13  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Made the date which is stored by
		gtranslator_config_set_last_run_date() localizable.

2000-10-05  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c/h: Changed the implicit void functions to
		be explicit void -- avoids 4 warnings.

2000-10-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Check the date string before storing
		it.

2000-10-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* test-lg.c: Changed some things.

	* parse-db.c: Added some more translatable strings,
		changed some stuff; still needs some days...

	* foo.xml: Indentation corrections.

	* handle-db.h/c: The gtranslator_add_node_to_doc function
		now also needs the filename to operate on the
		 given doc which is now saved by the way.

2000-10-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Changed the logic a bit; every config
		function now does init/close the preferences
		 part of libgtranslator itself, no need to do
		  this in "normal" code any longer.

2000-09-30  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Added two new functions which should
		store the last date on which gtranslator was run.

		Damned preferences stuff ...

	* parse-db.h: Removed the xml-defines as they seem to
		be useless.

	* foo.xml: Changed it too be more foo'sh.

	* handle-db.c: Changed the return values a bit and added
		another check.

2000-09-29  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Hmm, I think this is named GConf and
		not Gconf... :-)

	* main.c: Added some GConf stuff around it.

2000-09-24  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Hmm, the library version should also
		take the main version and add the GCONF_IS_PRESENT
		 define to the cflags.

	* test-lg.c: Also corrected gconf_init call here.

	* preferences.c: Declare the used gchar for the GConf
		back ends outside the function and corrected the
		 wrong function call for the set-methods of GConf,
		  removed the 2 debug g_print's.

2000-09-23  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse-db.c/h: Some cosmetic corrections.

	* team-handle.c: Free the used node but not the attribute
		which causes a segfault :(

	* handle-db.c: Corrected the add-routines and made them
		obviously working.

	* handle-db.h: Changed the function name from "add_node"
		to "gtranslator_add_node_to_doc" for name space
		 cleanity.

2000-09-21  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Hmm, FALSE is normally 0, so this shouldn't
		be a warning circumstance.

	* Makefile.am: Set up the version info for libgtranslator
		with the new $SUBVERSION variable.

2000-09-20  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Integrated the int/string/bool
		methods of our preferences engine; inserted some
		 more useful checks for missing/NULL entries
		  in the path/value pairs; use the real paths
		   for the GConf interactions.

	* Makefile.am: Also add the $(GNOME_CFLAGS) to the
		cflags.

	* preferences.c: Undefine the '_' if it's already defined
		as it would clash with the '_' from libgnome.
	
	* test-lg.c: Removed the xml-routines and integrating the
		preferences routines ( tests for all sorts ).

2000-09-19  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Added the new preferences source files
		to the libgtranslator sources and added the
		 $(GNOME_LIBS) to the library additions.

		Also added some conditionals for the library
		 chaos caused by our two-way strategy.

	* preferences.c: And this is the source file for the
		all this config stuff.

	* preferences.h: Added the gtranslator wrapper header
		for the config-stuff.

2000-09-18  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* .cvsignore: Added this test-libgtranslator program :)

2000-09-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Changed the name of the test-program to
		test-libgtranslator for more obviousity.

	* main.c: Simply print a foolish statement, so we do know
		if it works :)

2000-09-16  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse-db.h: Moved the xmldoc xmlDocPtr to the source file;
		avoids a warning message.
	
	* parse-db.c: Initialized the "addnode" xmlNodePtr; this also
		avoids a warning message.

2000-09-14  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse-db.h: Added some defines to avoid some libxml chaos
		( especially for Karl Eichenwalder :) ).

	* Makefile.am: Install the idl file into $(datadir)/idl/gtranslator
		and not $(datadir)/idl; hope this avoids a creasing idl-files
		 mass.

2000-08-06  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* .cvsignore: Added gtranslatord and test-lg.

2000-08-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Added the test-lg program to the targets
		and added foo.xml to the $(EXTRA_DIST).
			[ it isn't installed though. ]
	
	* test-lg.c: Added a test-program for the routines.

	* handle.c: Added a node-adding routines.

2000-08-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* main.c: Added the skeleton.

	* Makefile.am: Added the gtranslatord target and let
		it be build with all the nifty libs.

	* \*.c: Corrected some real typos.

	* parse-db.c: There's no xmlFreePtr, but a xmlFreeNode.

2000-08-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse-db.c: Free the nodes.

	* team-handle.c: Added the forgotten '/' before teams.xml.

2000-08-02  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* .cvsignore: Ignore the source navigator project files.

	* Makefile.am: Added the new source files and the headers.

	* parse-db.c/h: Added the gettext-stuff into the header and
		removed a cast which caused quizzes.

	* handle-db.c/h: Here will be more intelligent parsing
		routines.
	
	* team-handle.c/h: The handling routines for the translation
		teams offered by the future gtranslatord will be here.

2000-08-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse-db.c: Perform some checks for the file ( if it's
		empty and if it's the right type
		 [ if it starts with a <db> type entry .. ] ).

	* Makefile.am: Install the idl files into $(datadir)/idl;
		use libtool to build the library and build also a
		 dynamic version of it ( without version suffix ).
	
	* .cvsignore: Don't ignore all *.c/*.h files, just the ones
		generated from gtranslatord.idl.
	
	* parse-db.h: Added it to the headers' list ( install it ).
	
	* gtranslator.idl: Removed it.

	* gtranslatord.idl: Get rid of the warnings; don't
		use underscores.

	* Makefile.am: Added gtranslator.idl to the sources
		and to the clean target; added the message-db.d
 		 dir define.

	* gtranslator.idl: Added the gtranslator stuff.

	* parse-db.c: First tries.

2000-07-31  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* gtranslator.idl: Added copyright header.

	* parse-db.h: Added to noinst_HEADERS.

	* Makefile.am: Added the parse-db.c file
		to the sources and added the
		 $(XML_CFLAGS) to the INCLUDES.
	
	* parse-db.*: These files will contain the
		message db parsing code.
	
2000-07-28  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* ChangeLog: Added this.

	* gtranslatord.idl: Remove the Bonobo.idl
	  	reference.
