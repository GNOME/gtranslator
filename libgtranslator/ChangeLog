2000-10-23  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Some Makefile-stuff for getting the sources
		to build without manual intervenation and included
		 the enw files in the sources and in the include
		  targets.

	* gtranslator-preferences-dialog.c/.h: The new files for an
		own and more intelligent preferences dialog.

2000-10-16  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

        * preferences.c: Corrected a typo in a comment :-) Also
                remove the "/apps/gtranslator" directory from the
                 GConf client when closing down the preferences
                  stuff.

2000-10-15  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* stylistics.c/h: Put the gtranslator_set_style function
		here; it's good for manipulating two widgets'
		 style options ( preferrably for the two text
		  boxes of gtranslator ).

	* Makefile.am: Removed test-libgtranslator/test-lg.c
		from the sources and targets.
	
	* test-lg.c: Removed it due to uselessness.

	* stylistics.c: Added the routines and sources for the
		color storing/getting fucntions.

	* stylistics.h: Added this header which controls all the
		color based stuff within libgtranslator and added
		 an enumeration which defines what to store.

	* Makefile.am: Added the new "stylistics.c/h" files
		to the sources and headers list.

	* prefereces.h: Added the gfloat setting/getting
		routines.
	
	* prefereces.c: Corrected some wrong stuff within the date
		storing/getting routines, added the gfloat get/set-
		 methods and added defines to wrap the doubles into
		  the gfloat routines.

2000-10-13  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Made the date which is stored by
		gtranslator_config_set_last_run_date() localizable.

2000-10-05  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c/h: Changed the implicit void functions to
		be explicit void -- avoids 4 warnings.

2000-10-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Check the date string before storing
		it.

2000-10-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* test-lg.c: Changed some things.

	* parse-db.c: Added some more translatable strings,
		changed some stuff; still needs some days...

	* foo.xml: Indentation corrections.

	* handle-db.h/c: The gtranslator_add_node_to_doc function
		now also needs the filename to operate on the
		 given doc which is now saved by the way.

2000-10-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Changed the logic a bit; every config
		function now does init/close the preferences
		 part of libgtranslator itself, no need to do
		  this in "normal" code anylonger.

2000-09-30  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Added two new functions which should
		store the last date on which gtranslator was run.

		Damned preferences stuff ...

	* parse-db.h: Removed the xml-defines as they seem to
		be useless.

	* foo.xml: Changed it too be more foo'sh.

	* handle-db.c: Changed the return values a bit and added
		another check.

2000-09-29  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Hmm, I think this is named GConf and
		not Gconf... :-)

	* main.c: Added some GConf stuff around it.

2000-09-24  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Hmm, the library version should also
		take the mainversion and add the GCONF_IS_PRESENT
		 define to the cflags.

	* test-lg.c: Also corrected gconf_init call here.

	* preferences.c: Declare the used gchar for the GConf
		backends outside the function and corrected the
		 wrong function call for the set-methods of GConf,
		  removed the 2 debug g_print's.

2000-09-23  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse-db.c/h: Some cosmetic corrections.

	* team-handle.c: Free the used node but not the attribute
		which causes a segfault :(

	* handle-db.c: Corrected the add-routines and made them
		obviously working.

	* handle-db.h: Changed the function name from "add_node"
		to "gtranslator_add_node_to_doc" for namespace
		 cleanity.

2000-09-21  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Hmm, FALSE is normally 0, so this shouldn't
		be a warning circumstance.

	* Makefile.am: Set up the version info for libgtranslator
		with the new $SUBVERSION variable.

2000-09-20  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* preferences.c: Integrated the int/string/bool
		methods of our preferences engine; inserted some
		 more usefull checks for missing/NULL entries
		  in the path/value pairs; use the real paths
		   for the GConf interactions.

	* Makefile.am: Also add the $(GNOME_CFLAGS) to the
		cflags.

	* preferences.c: Undefine the '_' if it's already defined
		as it would clash with the '_' from libgnome.
	
	* test-lg.c: Removed the xml-routines and integrating the
		preferences routines ( tests for all sorts ).

2000-09-19  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Added the new preferences source files
		to the libgtranslator sources and added the
		 $(GNOME_LIBS) to the library additionals.

		Also added some conditionals for the library
		 chaos caused by our two-way strategy.

	* preferences.c: And this is the source file for the
		all this config stuff.

	* preferences.h: Added the gtranslator wrapper header
		for the config-stuff.

2000-09-18  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* .cvsignore: Added this test-libgtranslator programm :)

2000-09-17  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Changed the name of the test-programm to
		test-libgtranslator for more obviousity.

	* main.c: Simply print a foo'sh statement, so we do know
		if it works :)

2000-09-16  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse-db.h: Moved the xmldoc xmlDocPtr to the source file;
		avoids a warning message.
	
	* parse-db.c: Initialized the "addnode" xmlNodePtr; this also
		avoids a warning message.

2000-09-14  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse-db.h: Added some defines to avoid some libxml chaos
		( especially for Karl Eichenwalder :) ).

	* Makefile.am: Install the idl file into $(datadir)/idl/gtranslator
		and not $(datadir)/idl; hope this avoids a creasing idl-files
		 mass.

2000-08-06  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* .cvsignore: Added gtranslatord and test-lg.

2000-08-05  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Added the test-lg programm to the targets
		and added foo.xml to the $(EXTRA_DIST).
			[ it isn't installed though. ]
	
	* test-lg.c: Added a test-programm for the routines.

	* handle.c: Added a node-adding routines.

2000-08-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* main.c: Added the skeleton.

	* Makefile.am: Added the gtranslatord target and let
		it be build with all the nifty libs.

	* \*.c: Corrected some real typos.

	* parse-db.c: There's no xmlFreePtr, but a xmlFreeNode.

2000-08-03  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse-db.c: Free the nodes.

	* team-handle.c: Added the forgotten '/' before teams.xml.

2000-08-02  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* .cvsignore: Ignore the sourcenavigator project files.

	* Makefile.am: Added the new source files and the headers.

	* parse-db.c/h: Added the gettext-stuff into the header and
		removed a cast which caused quizzle.

	* handle-db.c/h: Here will be more intelligent parsing
		routines.
	
	* team-handle.c/h: The handling routines for the translation
		teams offered by the future gtranslatord will be here.

2000-08-01  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* parse-db.c: Perform some checks for the file ( if it's
		empty and if it's the right type
		 [ if it starts with a <db> type entry .. ] ).

	* Makefile.am: Install the idl files into $(datadir)/idl;
		use libtool to build the library and build also a
		 dynamic version of it ( without version suffix ).
	
	* .cvsignore: Don't ignore all *.c/*.h files, just the ones
		generated from gtranslatord.idl.
	
	* parse-db.h: Added it to the headers' list ( install it ).
	
	* gtranslator.idl: Removed it.

	* gtranslatord.idl: Get rid of the warnings; don't
		use underscores.

	* Makefile.am: Added gtranslator.idl to the sources
		and to the clean target; added the message-db.d
 		 dir define.

	* gtranslator.idl: Added the gtranslator stuff.

	* parse-db.c: First tries.

2000-07-31  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gmx.net>

	* gtranslator.idl: Added copyright header.

	* parse-db.h: Added to noinst_HEADERS.

	* Makefile.am: Added the parse-db.c file
		to the sources and added the
		 $(XML_CFLAGS) to the INCLUDES.
	
	* parse-db.*: These files will conatin the
		message db parsing code.
	
2000-07-28  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* ChangeLog: Added this.

	* gtranslatord.idl: Remove the Bonobo.idl
	  	reference.
