NEWS from gtranslator R 0.23 ( aka. 0.22cvs-past ):
--------------------------------------------------

- The dot char feature works now; it's selectable in the preferences.
- An foo'sh update function has been added which does an update on
   the po-files if you've got the whole source of the programm.
    ( For now a script does this, possibly here will be some heavy 
       development in the next time ).
- A recent files menu has been added; this does also need much more work
   to get useful.
- Added some new options to the preferences.
- The GConf trouble is over, you can now really compile (lib-)gtranslator
   with GConf-support for the preferences stuff without any problems
    ( tested with GConf 0.10 and 0.9cvs ).
- Corrected the rpm-specs :-)

NEWS from gtranslator R 0.21:
----------------------------

- Made the first public release :)
- Updated and corrected all plain documents.
- The gtranslator programm itself works now.
- There's now also a Galician translation ( thanks to Jesus Bravo Alvarez ) and
   a Lithuanian translation ( thanks to the well known "./src-guy" Gediminas
    Paulauskaus ).
- Almost all translations have been updated.
- libgtranslator have been started to be written ( huh ?! ).
