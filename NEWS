- New "Yet enhanced fortune" colorscheme (a bit `different' I know...)
- New "build-gtranslator-learn-buffer.sh" script in the "data/scripts"
   subdirectory of the distro and in "${datadir}/gtranslator/scripts" which
    helps you to build up a learn buffer with gtranslator a bit easier then
     via manual ways.

   submenu -- no more you have to go to the preferences dialog just for a
    simple colorscheme change.

- New "ToyFactory" colorscheme...

   adaptation colorscheme).

   script (it works now and asks the user if it should do what it'd did without
