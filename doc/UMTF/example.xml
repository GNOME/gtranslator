	The database language, e.g. Turkish or German including some more 
	 information on the language.
	
	This should also be an attribute-only tag as a database file should
	 only include _a_ language.

	Attributes are:
		ename 	-> English name
		name	-> Localized own name
		code	-> The language code, possibly also in long
				notation, e.g. tr_TR.
		email	-> The languages translation mailing list.
		href	-> An URL for more information about the team.

<!--
	If the whole database is only being maintained by one person, then this
	 person should be "declared" globally as the translator.
	
	If you do declare a translation here, you'd be aware that this tag is 
	 for now a only-attribute tag and has to be closed immediately.
	
	You can also set "id" attributes in here to list up the general list of
	 translators once on the head of the file and then ref to them via "tid"
	  as the ref attribute. A small list is provided in here. A reference
	   via the "name" attribute should also be possible.

<translator name="Mr. Bar" email="bar@bar.com" tid="2"/>

		  attribute which declares the first translated version of the

		This last premiereversion attribute is only _optional_ and 
		 should be left out if not known.

		There should be an updated attribute for every resource which
		 defines the last update of any resource reference update.
	
		In case that there hasn't been any update, you should leave
		 that attribute out of course.

		Another new attribute is the "href" attribute which can be put
		 on every resource to provide an URL where one could get more
		  information about this resource (homepage or similar stuff).
