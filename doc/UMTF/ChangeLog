	* \* & Makefile.am: Added UMTF specs to gtranslator/doc/ in GNOME CVS
		for further inclusion and attraction.

	* umtf.dtd: Added official UMTF 1.0 DTD.

	* \*: Brand new views for UMTF and the README file is growing in size:
		/me hopes this all will get useful for gtranslator in the
                 nearby time.

	* README.UMTF & *.xml: New version 1.0 of the specification and some
		updates on the information front regarding KBabel et al. Also
		 did describe the new stuff for this release in the spec and
		  the example file.
		
		New in this version 1.0 of the specification are:

		* The new version number 1.0 :-)
		
		* You can now define "href" URL attributes for two tags via
			which the user could get more information (there are
			 the "language" and the "resource" tags).
			
		* The "translator" tag can now also get an attribute "tid" (=
			Translator ID) via which you can ref the translators
 			 who are globally listed once in the buffer and then
			  ref'd by the "tid" attribute on the translator->value
			   tag.
		
		* And the most important piece of news: we have got now a new
			"buffer" tag which must be present from now on and
			  encapsulates all the message/translation value pairs
			   in it; it has got also a mandatory attribute
			    "entries" which simply defines how many messages
 			      entries are present in the buffer.

	* tr.xml: Removed the Turkish base file from here, as it's not needed.

		for the umtf root node.

		numbers there; updated EMail addresses and pointed Semerkent
