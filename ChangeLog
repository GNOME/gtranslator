	* configure.in: Substitute the values in the spec file.

	* gtranslator.spec.in: Added spec file for gtranslator (half from

	* Makefile.am: Remove README.GConf from the EXTRA_DIST files.

		   useful.

	* data/desktop/gtranslator.png: Another icon try from me.

2001-03-29  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* configure.in: simplified/fixed checks. Moved required libraries to

	enough. Made --enable-debug and --without-gconf options, correctly
	detect gnome-vfs-1.0

2001-03-29  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* help/C/Makefile.am: Use the new $(SC_STATEDIR) variable for

2001-03-25  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* AUTHORS & THANKS: Moved Thomas to the thanks section as he did
		"only" the bug-tester and the find implementation.

	* help/C/gtranslator.sgml && help/C/Makefile.am: Updated and
		rewrote the docs; updated the Makefile.am accordingly.

		(do not accept wrong options, exit in the case of
		  a non-existing/not supported option), added a 
		   "ignore" function with which you can exclude po 
		     files from the anounce circle (e.g. "en_GB")
		      and made the error messages nicer.
		      
	* Makefile.am: Removed the ominous "0.5" file deletion as this
		is now not any more put out by configure.

	* configure.in: Added the new colorschemes, oaf and ui subdirectory
		of our data repository to the output Makefiles and added
		 a nautilus prefix option and a check around it to make it
		  possible to also compile the nautilus-view if possible
		   (if a prefix is given it checks for the mainly used
		     nautilus_view_standard_mail_multi function from 
		      libnautilus).

	* Makefile.am: Remove po/update.sh from the dist.

	* configure.in: Damn fixes to the --enable-debugspecs option

	* help/C/Makefile.am, help/C/topic.dat & help/C/gtranslator.sgml:
		Made the two thanks pages be only one page to improve the
		 help menu in gtranslator itself a bit.

	* DEPENDS: The window-icon feature of libgnomeui is only available
		after gnome-libs 1.2.0; this is just an update of the
		 information about the dependance on gnome-libs -- the check
		  for the functions is version independent and right.

	* configure.in: Changed the "--with-debug-specs" to be now
		--enable-debugspecs and to work like wished; also improved/
		 advanced the check for the window icon to work now with the
		  global setting of the window icon.

	* NEWS & README: Now we're working on 0.37.

	* NEWS: Added NEWS item about the enhanced and now also in a distpack
		included pozilla -- the best pozilla ever .-)

	* pozilla.sh: Check after the option switch for the po directory
		--  so you can now also call pozilla --help without having
		 a direct po directory and added an option to define a
		  different po directory location instead of the default case
		   where the po directory is just "./po" -- a big change and
		    therefore R 1.5.

	* Makefile.am: Also include pozilla.sh in a dist. and install it
		as a script executable.

2001-02-21  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* README: Added notice about http://bugzilla.gnome.org.

	* pozilla.sh: Implemented the really useful "-s/--send" option
		which sends the updated and merged po file to the last
		 translator (useful if the last translator hasn't got
		  CVS access) and execute all the commands under a "C"
		   LANG environment and recover the previous environment
		    after pozilla.sh has finished -- this is definitely R 1.2.

	* HACKING & DEPENDS: Small cosmetics and removals.

	* NEWS: Added notice about this new file with informations for
		selft-compilers/builders.

	* Makefile.am: Added the README.GConf file to the dist. files.

	* pozilla.sh: Clean up the temporary mail body file -- version 1.1.

2001-02-18  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* pozilla.sh: gtranslator is now also featuring a plain version
		string, so we don't need to have a case tree anymore --
		 this is version 1.0.1.
	
	* man/.cvsignore: Added "gtranslator.1.gz" to the cvsignores.

	* man/Makefile.am: Always supply a gzip'ed man-page and don't include

		 ./configure script.

		line argument (it's "--webalize", not "--webalizer").
