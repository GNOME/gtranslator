2007-09-09  Ignacio Casal Quinteiro  <nacho.resa@gmail.com>

	Patch by Sean Burke: Thanks a lot.

	This patch does a few things: it renames configure.in to configure.ac (to start
	cleaning up build and using more recent conventions), removes
	SPELLCHECKER_CFLAGS from the Makefile as it appears to be undefined, forces use
	of a more recent automake version, moves the UI XML files to data/ and modifies
	the Makefile there to install it and modifies the source file that opens
	gtranslator-ui to point to the correct directory. It also fixes the
	aforementioned build errors.

2003-06-18  Fatih Demir <kabalak@kabalak.net>

	* debian/changelog: Prepared it for the normal working case - now only
		the release date and #s will change, no changelog entry will
		 come in for that except for greater changes from now on :-)

2003-06-16  Fatih Demir <kabalak@kabalak.net>

	* Makefile.am: Adepted CVS snapshot rule to produce Debian friendly
		release date packages like "gtranslator-1.0.DATE-WITHOUT-DASH"
		 to get Debian building wholly happy now.

	* pozilla.sh: Adapted script for not having ":" as the 1st line but
		"#!/bin/sh" like Debian does want it - now lintian should be
		 also happy about our self-build Debian packages.

	* debian/: Did transfer my own and currently working debian/ files
		into CVS & removed the old ones from CVS from Ryan which I
		 did use as skeleton for my updated/new files. Now debian
  		  building should work out of the box.

	* man/gtranslator.1.in: Small corrections as we can't currently simply
		give a file name as an argument to gtranslator to get opened
		 directly out of the command line.

	* BRANCHES: Updated branch information for the current HEAD branch
		and added some more words for our release tagging of the prev.
		 done releases of gtranslator.

	* README: Small extension of the README file for Ross being the
		new main developer and some more bug filing encouraging words
		 for the README-reading folks out there.

		thanks listing there :-)

		removed the "data/etspecs/" Makefile from the output files'
		 list as the dir is now being removed from CVS.

		 to the new stuff.

2003-06-10  Fatih Demir <kabalak@kabalak.net>

		should now get a new RPM spec file as the old one seems to be 
		 very outdated..

	* acconfig.h & configure.in: Removed the configuration of the mime type
		binding files in the ./configure routine - the mime file is now
		 installed per default so that gtranslator is automatically
		  bind to po files (no option present for this anymore during
		   the ./configure cases).

	* BRANCHES: Updated the information about the versionitis & branches/
		development.

	* AUTHORS & THANKS: Cleaned up AUTHORS file a bit and moved most
		thankful addition-doing people to the THANKS file.

	* .cvsignore: Slightly extended for the dist packages.

	* pozilla.sh: Release 3.0 -- a small tweak in the awk print's:

		 format parameters and made pozilla be more tolerant about
		  errors, now it does simply jump over the fallible/warning
		   creating po file and doesn't stop operating; it's also

		     files from the anounce circle (e.g. "en_GB")

		of our data repository to the output Makefiles and added
		 a nautilus prefix option and a check around it to make it
		  possible to also compile the nautilus-view if possible
		   (if a prefix is given it checks for the mainly used
		     nautilus_view_standard_mail_multi function from
		      libnautilus).

		Made the two thanks pages be only one page to improve the
		 help menu in gtranslator itself a bit.

	* DEPENDS: The window-icon feature of libgnomeui is only available
		after gnome-libs 1.2.0; this is just an update of the
		 information about the dependance on gnome-libs -- the check
		  for the functions is version independent and right.

	* configure.in: Changed the "--with-debug-specs" to be now
		--enable-debugspecs and to work like wished; also improved/
		 advanced the check for the window icon to work now with the
