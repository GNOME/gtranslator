		output of the checks.

	* Added another option to configure.in ( and to
		the resulting ./configure script ) whether to bind
		 po-files with gtranslator, whether to install the
		  gtranslator.mime & gtranslator.keys files

		     and gtranslator is not fully ready to rally with
		      these ones. ]

		`outlook'.

		 without a "checking Checking ..".
