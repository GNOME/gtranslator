		binding files in the ./configure routine - the mime file is now
		 installed per default so that gtranslator is automatically
		  bind to po files (no option present for this anymore during

		development.

2001-10-28  Fatih Demir <kabalak@kabalak.net>

		BTW: I did also move the "config directory" of pozilla.sh to
		 "~/.gtranslator/pozilla/" from "~/.pozilla" -- this should
		  show the very high grade of relativeness between pozilla.sh
		   and gtranslator.

	* NEWS: Small update of the pozilla.sh news item as we did have got
		now a 3.0 version with many news and tweaks.

	* pozilla.sh: Release 3.0 -- a small tweak in the awk print's:
		made the percentage determination use printf and "%.2f"
		 format parameters and made pozilla be more tolerant about
		  errors, now it does simply jump over the fallible/warning
		   creating po file and doesn't stop operating; it's also
		    much quieter now and shortens the long Chinese locales.

2001-03-29  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

		(do not accept wrong options, exit in the case of
		  a non-existing/not supported option), added a
		   "ignore" function with which you can exclude po
		     files from the anounce circle (e.g. "en_GB")

2001-03-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@kabalak.net>

	* configure.in: Hack back for xml-i18n-tools -- got back to

	* configure.in: Added the new colorschemes, oaf and ui subdirectory
		of our data repository to the output Makefiles and added
		 a nautilus prefix option and a check around it to make it
		  possible to also compile the nautilus-view if possible
		   (if a prefix is given it checks for the mainly used
		     nautilus_view_standard_mail_multi function from
		      libnautilus).

	* Makefile.am: Remove po/update.sh from the dist.

	* configure.in: Damn fixes to the --enable-debugspecs option

		Made the two thanks pages be only one page to improve the
		 help menu in gtranslator itself a bit.

	* DEPENDS: The window-icon feature of libgnomeui is only available
		after gnome-libs 1.2.0; this is just an update of the
		 information about the dependance on gnome-libs -- the check
		  for the functions is version independent and right.

	* configure.in: Changed the "--with-debug-specs" to be now
		--enable-debugspecs and to work like wished; also improved/
		 advanced the check for the window icon to work now with the

	* NEWS & README: Now we're working on 0.37.

		--  so you can now also call pozilla --help without having

		  different po directory location instead of the default case
		   where the po directory is just "./po" -- a big change and
		    therefore R 1.5.

	* Makefile.am: Also include pozilla.sh in a dist. and install it
		as a script executable.

2001-02-21  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@kabalak.net>

	* README: Added notice about http://bugzilla.gnome.org.

	* pozilla.sh: Implemented the really useful "-s/--send" option
		which sends the updated and merged po file to the last
		 translator (useful if the last translator hasn't got
		  CVS access) and execute all the commands under a "C"
		   LANG environment and recover the previous environment
		    after pozilla.sh has finished -- this is definitely R 1.2.

	* HACKING & DEPENDS: Small cosmetics and removals.

	* NEWS: Added notice about this new file with informations for
		selft-compilers/builders.

	* Makefile.am: Added the README.GConf file to the dist. files.

2001-02-18  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@kabalak.net>

	* pozilla.sh: gtranslator is now also featuring a plain version

		 this is version 1.0.1.
	
	* man/.cvsignore: Added "gtranslator.1.gz" to the cvsignores.

		file for the language order ( me
		 stupido .. )
