	+	Set version number to 0.18 -- everything works
		
		-- besides the main point of interest.

	+	Added a missing AM_CONDITIONAL

	+	Corrected typos and errors and beautified the

		output of the checks.

	+	Added another option to configure.in ( and to
		
		the resulting ./configure script ) whether to bind
		
		po-files with gtranslator, whether to install the
		
		gtranslator.mime & gtranslator.keys files

		[ You'd have bind them to VIm/(X)EMacs for example,
		
		and gtranslator is not fully ready to rally with 
	
		these ones. ]
	
	+	Removed some previous stuff from the Makefile.am.

	+	Updated all plain text-files for a more common
		
		`outlook'

		without a "checking Checking ..".
