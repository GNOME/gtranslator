HACKING instructions for gtranslator :-)
-------------------------------------

Other than in some modules of GNOME's CVS repository, you can
 can contribute any kind of useful and working code or correction
  into the repository _without_ asking me or any other person.
 
This is a encouragement for helping us :-)

No indentation rules, only the magical ChangeLog entry is mandatory,
 the rest is Open Mind-Ness; I'm absolutely pedantic on ChangeLog entries
  so please don't forget them and describe what you've done very clearly.

A "rightly formed" (TM) ChangeLog entry should be like this:

--------------------------------------------------- ChangeLog snippet

	YEAR-MO-DA  NAME  <EMAIL>
		
		* FILE(S): Description which starts with a capital letter.
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------		

Some might know the story about the "Bazaar" and the Open Source; in
 most cases this story ain't be true, but for gtranslator it's really
  applicable, as you can do here everything useful.
