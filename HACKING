HACKING instructions for gtranslator :-)
-------------------------------------

Other than in some modules of GNOME's CVS repository, you can
 can contribute any kind of useful and working code or correction
  into the repository _without_ asking me or any other person.
 
This is a encouragement for helping me :-)

No indentation rules, only the magical ChangeLog entry is mandatory,
 the rest is Open Mind-Ness ( for future release we'll probably apply a
  indent run on gtranslator's sources to end this code, indentation etc.
   jungle in the sources :-)).

And any improvement, crucially important idea should also be added to
 the TODO file in the main directory. No limits!

Some might know the story about the "Bazaar" and the Open Source; in
 most cases this story ain't be true, but for gtranslator it's really
  applicable, as you can do here everything useful ( a smell-extension
   plug-in for example :-)).

[ But that's no surprise, as we're having Pazars (->Bazaar) and how should
 Finnish or American people without Bazaars develop code in the Bazaar-style
  , or am I wrong ?!?! ]
