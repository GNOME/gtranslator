gtranslator R 0.14 --->


	gtranslator will be a translation-supporting programm for the Gnome
	project . It is offering little funtionability yet but it will be 
	more expandable later on . 
	
	Till now I base this programm mostly on some scipts ; it could be 
	that some parts will be written in native C later on ; so I've started
	to write the parser module in C ( that will take some time ..) .
	
	Have a look at it and you'll see that it isn't/couldn't be finished 
	or really satisfying till this moment .
 
	If you want to have a usable version wait till R 0.2 , I think till 
	this version it should be ready-to-use .
