gtranslator R 0.12 --->


	gtranslator will be a translation-supporting programm for the Gnome
	project . It is offering little funtionability yet but it will be 
	more expandable later on . 
	
	Till now I base this programm mostly on some scipts ; it could be 
	that some parts will be written in native C later on ( Gnome-CVS ?).
	
	Have a look at it and you'll ee that it isn't/couldn't be finished 
	or really satisfying till this moment .
