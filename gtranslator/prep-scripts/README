gtranslator R 0.12 ---->

	Here are some scripts that gtranslator uses for making it easier
	to expand it later ( or to fugee from stupid constructs .... ).
	
	Exactly said , I misuse this scripts to avoid some read-search 
	actions in the .po-files ; the split_it_with_awk.sh-script does
	nothing else than ripping all the msgids & msgstrs into special
	files , for example .
	
	The complex.sh script calls the other scripts for gtranslator ,
	so it's much more scripts-based as it should be ?!?!
		
	Feel free to add some scripts AND C-constructs for similar \
	work .
