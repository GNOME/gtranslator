Things that need attention:

    - The file containing the msgstr's has an extra empty
      line at the top. So all messages are off by one. I
      think the problem is in the scripts. And probably
      it's related to the next problem.
      
    - msgid's starting on the line following msgid "" aren't
      taken into account. ie
      msgid ""
      "The string starts on this line"
      msgstr ""
      "The translation starts here"
      
    - sed is not found if it's in /bin
    
    - the scripts use /usr/share/ even if the default (/usr/local/share)
      is used. The problem is in using gnome-config to add $DATADIR when
      installing in a different prefix than gnome-libs is in.

    - segfault if you walk backwards past the first message
    
    - segfault when walking back and forth a few times

    - segfault when pressing "Last" button sometimes
    
    - could some of the code from emacs' po-mode.el be stolen for
      handling of .po files?
      
    - gettext's po-mode.el contains regexps for a complete msgid and
      msgstr, maybe use these to fix the two first problems.
